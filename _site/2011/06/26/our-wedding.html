    <p><p>May 28th 2011. &nbsp;A day I'll never forget; the day Jo and I got married. &nbsp;It's always difficult finding the time to write new posts, but I'd be remiss if I didn't at the very least make sure I wrote something about, clich&eacute; as it may be, the happiest day of my life. &nbsp;We'd originally planned the wedding for 10th October 2010: of course that date was nothing to do with the fact that 10-10-10 is easy to remember; not was it in any way related to the fact that 101010 in binary represents 42 in decimal -- "the answer to life, the universe, and everything"! &nbsp;That date wasn't to be, due in no small part to a severe lack of funds and planning. &nbsp;Fast forward to May 28th 2011 and having spent a not-exorbitant sum of money on eBay enjoyed a perfectly planned and executed wedding day in Edinburgh. &nbsp;The weather was even good to us - it only rained when we were inside! &nbsp;A massive thanks to Jo's bridesmaids, Jess and Mip for supporting and helping her; my best man Sally for her support and help; my dad for doing a wonderful job of the photography and of course my beautiful wife Jo for doing me the greatest honour of marrying me!<!--more--></p>

<p>The ceremony itself was at Lothian Chambers Registrar's Office on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh with the magnificent and beautiful St. Giles' Cathedral to the rear of the building. &nbsp;The ceremony began at 15:00 and thankfully all the guests arrived on time! &nbsp;I arrived with Sally shortly before and had an opportunity to greet the guests before we were seated in the Melbourne Suite. &nbsp;Then the waiting began... I didn't doubt for a moment that there would be any problems, but from being seated to Jo and her dad Colin entering the room felt like an eternity.</p>

<p>Neko Case's 'At Last' played as&nbsp;Jo came in to the room. &nbsp;I couldn't help but grin like a crazy person from ear to ear, she looked beautiful; amazing; happy; if slightly nervous. &nbsp;It must have been quite a dusty room because there may have been a few tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. &nbsp;After the ceremony when we signed the register we had Stevie Wonder's 'Signed, Sealed Delivered' playing in the background. &nbsp;Then we headed outside where my dad took some brilliant photos of us all. &nbsp;Thankfully the weather stayed on our side for the most part. &nbsp;Jo and I were driven to our reception at 28 York Place a little ahead of the other guests -- a welcome opportunity to take it all in and have some time to ourselves to relax before the party started!</p>

<p>We had a lovely meal with the rest of our wedding guests before the evening guests arrived. &nbsp;Given that my best man was Sally, our wedding mildly eschewed tradition so it seemed fitting for Jo to give a speech in place of her dad, Colin. &nbsp;Sally then gave the traditional best man's speech which thankfully painted me in a good light without leaving me burying my head in my hands with&nbsp;embarrassment!</p>

<p>The party continued in to the early hours, but was thankfully briefly punctuated by some gratefully received bacon and sausage rolls, and some delicious and beautifully decorated cupcakes; the hard work courtesy of my wife and her bridesmaids. &nbsp;We both owe a big thanks to Sue and the rest of the staff at The Police Club. &nbsp;We were fortunate enough to be given many generous gifts by our family and friends, which have since been put toward a nice long break to Nice in October. &nbsp;After the wedding, we took a day to relax and recuperate before our honeymoon in Paris. &nbsp;There'll be more about that in another post soon.</p>
