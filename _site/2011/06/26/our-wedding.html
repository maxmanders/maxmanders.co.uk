    <p><p>May 28th 2011. &#160;A day I&#8217;ll never forget; the day Jo and I got married. &#160;It&#8217;s always difficult finding the time to write new posts, but I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t at the very least make sure I wrote something about, clich&#233; as it may be, the happiest day of my life. &#160;We&#8217;d originally planned the wedding for 10th October 2010: of course that date was nothing to do with the fact that 10-10-10 is easy to remember; not was it in any way related to the fact that 101010 in binary represents 42 in decimal &#8211; &#8220;the answer to life, the universe, and everything&#8221;! &#160;That date wasn&#8217;t to be, due in no small part to a severe lack of funds and planning. &#160;Fast forward to May 28th 2011 and having spent a not-exorbitant sum of money on eBay enjoyed a perfectly planned and executed wedding day in Edinburgh. &#160;The weather was even good to us - it only rained when we were inside! &#160;A massive thanks to Jo&#8217;s bridesmaids, Jess and Mip for supporting and helping her; my best man Sally for her support and help; my dad for doing a wonderful job of the photography and of course my beautiful wife Jo for doing me the greatest honour of marrying me!<!--more--></p>

<p>The ceremony itself was at Lothian Chambers Registrar&#8217;s Office on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh with the magnificent and beautiful St. Giles&#8217; Cathedral to the rear of the building. &#160;The ceremony began at 15:00 and thankfully all the guests arrived on time! &#160;I arrived with Sally shortly before and had an opportunity to greet the guests before we were seated in the Melbourne Suite. &#160;Then the waiting began&#8230; I didn&#8217;t doubt for a moment that there would be any problems, but from being seated to Jo and her dad Colin entering the room felt like an eternity.</p>

<p>Neko Case&#8217;s &#8216;At Last&#8217; played as&#160;Jo came in to the room. &#160;I couldn&#8217;t help but grin like a crazy person from ear to ear, she looked beautiful; amazing; happy; if slightly nervous. &#160;It must have been quite a dusty room because there may have been a few tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. &#160;After the ceremony when we signed the register we had Stevie Wonder&#8217;s &#8216;Signed, Sealed Delivered&#8217; playing in the background. &#160;Then we headed outside where my dad took some brilliant photos of us all. &#160;Thankfully the weather stayed on our side for the most part. &#160;Jo and I were driven to our reception at 28 York Place a little ahead of the other guests &#8211; a welcome opportunity to take it all in and have some time to ourselves to relax before the party started!</p>

<p>We had a lovely meal with the rest of our wedding guests before the evening guests arrived. &#160;Given that my best man was Sally, our wedding mildly eschewed tradition so it seemed fitting for Jo to give a speech in place of her dad, Colin. &#160;Sally then gave the traditional best man&#8217;s speech which thankfully painted me in a good light without leaving me burying my head in my hands with&#160;embarrassment!</p>

<p>The party continued in to the early hours, but was thankfully briefly punctuated by some gratefully received bacon and sausage rolls, and some delicious and beautifully decorated cupcakes; the hard work courtesy of my wife and her bridesmaids. &#160;We both owe a big thanks to Sue and the rest of the staff at The Police Club. &#160;We were fortunate enough to be given many generous gifts by our family and friends, which have since been put toward a nice long break to Nice in October. &#160;After the wedding, we took a day to relax and recuperate before our honeymoon in Paris. &#160;There&#8217;ll be more about that in another post soon.</p>
