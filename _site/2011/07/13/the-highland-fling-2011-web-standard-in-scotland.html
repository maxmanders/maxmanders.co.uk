  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>July 8th 2011 saw the welcome and eagerly anticipated return of <a href='http://thehighlandfling.com/'>"The Highland Fling -- Web Standards in Scotland"</a>. &#160;Set up and organised by <a href='http://www.azcazandco.com/'>Alan White</a> in 2007 to increase awareness of web standards and best practice, it&#8217;s the only conference of it&#8217;s kind in Scotland. &#160;I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have been able to attend each conference, although there was a hiatus in 2009/2010. &#160;The inaugural event really set the bar high for what could be achieved by a dedicated developer passionate about his work.<!--more--></p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the day, which got under way with an opening by Alan and the host for the day, <a href='http://www.wait-till-i.com/'>Christian Heilmann</a>. &#160;The presentations were all of an extremely high standard, and I took something away from each of them. &#160;Perhaps however because of my preference for getting my hands dirty with PHP and tinkering with Linux gubbins I found some of the talks a little high-level and abstract. &#160;That should nevertheless detract from the outstanding talks and the wonderful day I had. &#160;I do believe though that I may have got more out of the day were I more of a freelance front-end developer. &#160;I&#8217;m impatiently waiting for next year&#8217;s conference, which can&#8217;t come soon enough!</p>

<p>With an overarching theme of back-to-basics,&#160;<a href='http://nascentguruism.com/'>Steve Marshall</a>&#160;kicked things off with a very interesting discussion about keeping things as simple as they need to be. &#160;From getting lead astray by cognitive biases to avoiding over complicating and thinking too far ahead Steve hammered home the point that if we don&#8217;t take that next step, we&#8217;ll get nowhere fast.</p>

<p>Steve was followed by <a href='http://rachelandrew.co.uk/'>Rachel Andrew</a> who <a href='http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2011/07/08/your-cms-as-curator-of-your-design-and-content/'>discussed</a> <a href='http://www.slideshare.net/rachelandrew/choosing-the-right-content-management-system-8542709'>choosing</a> the right CMS. &#160;Everyone has their own set of favourite applications, and this applies equally to web applications. &#160;However, when developing a stand-alone CMS, or deploying one as part of a larger system, it pays to choose the right tool for the job. &#160;Sometimes a simple solution is what is required, other times something more &#8216;enterprise&#8217; will be required. &#160;Ultimately though, the choice should enable the user to publish their content without hindering them. &#160;The content should be front-and-centre, with the CMS seamlessly facilitating publication of great content.</p>

<p>The next talk before lunch was given by Glasgow developer <a href='http://jackosborne.co.uk/'>Jack Osbourne</a>, one of the contributors to <a href='http://html5doctor.com/'>HTML5 Doctor</a>. &#160;Jack offered a whistle-stop tour through the key new elements defined by the HTML5 specification, given as a novel &#8216;live&#8217; presentation where each element was demoed in place as part of the HTML5 rendered slides.</p>

<p>After lunch, the wonderfully entertaining <a href='http://remysharp.com/'>Remy Sharp</a> kicked the afternoon off with a presentation that by his own admission, was a little out of his comfort zone. &#160;Rather than what one might expect from Remy; a rather technical discussion about JavaScript and it&#8217;s proper application, he shared his personal workflow for fulfilling specifications. &#160;It wasn&#8217;t what I had expected but I really enjoyed it! &#160;It&#8217;s always interesting to see how other people work, and to learn from those who are clearly successful!</p>

<p>Next up was <a href='http://flyosity.com/'>Mike Rundle</a>; clearly a passionate designer/developer particularly with respect to all things Apple! &#160;Mike&#8217;s presentation elaborated on why the Mac design works so well. &#160;He explored Apple&#8217;s use of real world textures and their use application of consistent light sources to create a consistent, polished interface. &#160;Not usually my cup of tea; I&#8217;ve never really been the creative type. &#160;An interested talk nonetheless.</p>

<p>The final presentation of the day came courtesy of <a href='http://www.brothercake.com/'>James Edwards</a>&#160;who discussed the issue of whether the use of AJAX had become any more &#8216;accessible&#8217; over the last five years. The conclusion was a resounding &#8216;meh&#8217;. However, some problems can be mitigated by employing the WAI-ARIA&#160;spec to aid those viewing the web using technologies other than the traditional web browser. What followed was a slightly tangential discussion of using ARIA attributes to customise web forms to make them more useful for those experiencing the web through less traditional methods. Quite a technical discussion on a subject that isn&#8217;t well understood by most. &#160;An excellent talk!</p>

<p>In summary, although not a particular creative type I found this conference enjoyable and informative and commend Alan and his minions who made it all possible. &#160;If there were some slightly more technically oriented topics in future, that would be a big plus for me. &#160;A massive thank you to the speakers who took the time to head north of the border. &#160;I&#8217;m genuinely excited by the future of The Highland Fling and look forward to next year&#8217;s conference.</p></p>
