<title>Java - this and that - Max Manders</title>
        
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="description" content="My work has recently taken a departure from the usual web development as I&#8217;ve been &#8220;borrowed&#8221; by the other development team to help out with a Java project. Now, my Java is reasonable sound but yesterday I came across a curious situation involving passing about the current object.

In common with a lot of languages, the current object is represented by the &#8216;this&#8217; keyword. I wanted to pass &#8216;this&#8217; to a static method of another class. Of course, I can&#8217;t refer to the object as &#8216;this&#8217; in the static method context as that would be ambiguous insofar as it could refer to the class with the static method I&#8217;m working with. This pattern is often used with callbacks where for example you might want to register a class with a particular listener objcet. To avoid confusion, I named the actual parameter in the static method that I assumed that I would reference the fields and methods of the object using that.someMethod() rather than this.someMethod() This is where the fun begins. Let&#8217;s call the original object SomeObject theObject and I want to call the static method SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that) I would call that method, from within theObject, using SomeClass.doStaticMethod(this) When in theObject, I have access to private fields and methods since private fields and methods are within scope. I assumed the same would be true when I passed &#8220;theObject&#8221; as &#8220;this&#8221; to &#8220;SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that)&#8221;. However, when I actually try to access private fields such as &#8220;that.privateField&#8221;, it would appear that I no longer have access. I could create appropriate accessor methods, but that would defeat the idea of encapsulation.

Does anyone have any ideas? Am I missing some fundamental (and so obvious I missed it) rule of scope or object passing?" />
