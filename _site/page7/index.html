    <p><p>I&#8217;ve been writing a small Python/Tk application and until recently was having trouble with menu item callback functions.&#160; I have a series of menu items, all of which do much the same thing, but within the context of an item-specific ID.&#160; Therefore it would make sense to have a generic function that takes some parameter to determine what to do.</p>

    <p><p>Smoking is bad. I realise that. But like any addiction, no amount of rational discourse will disuade me from enjoying a cigarette. Believe me, I&#8217;m very much aware of the arguements against it.</p>

<p>However, smokers are not carriers of some hideous contagion. If I want to smoke while waiting for a bus, I&#8217;ll respectful head to the end of the queue away from others. You don&#8217;t want to be bothered by my smoke, and I respect that. I do however object to Joe Public ignoring the ample space in front of me and queuing as only the British can, behind me; glaring at me all the while for polluting their personal space. If you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t hover beside me when there is plenty of room for you to breathe the air that is polluted only by our own industrial and other emissions.</p>

<p>Here endeth the rant. If you can find it in yourself to not voluntarily subject yourself to passive smoking and then vilify me as if I made you do it, I would be most apreciative.</p></p>

    <p><p>I&#8217;ve been somewhat remiss in updating this site in recent times. This has largely been due to my being incredibly busy. Since saying farewell to <a href='http://www.valleyt.co.uk'>Valley Technology</a>, I&#8217;ve joined <a href='http://www.dietchef.co.uk'>Diet Chef</a> as their web developer and general IT jack-of-all-trades. I&#8217;m pleased to say I&#8217;m enjoying the varied work, but look forward to finding time for some more personal projects, including further developing <a href='http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk'>"Where are the shops?"</a>.</p>

<p>I also think, due to the ubiquity of various social networks (vis-a-vis Facebook, Twitter et al.) and the iPhone, I tend to blog less, favouring to send updates to a number of social networking sites.&#160; This has lead me to conclude that the present incarnation of the site isn&#8217;t really working for me.&#160; Over the next month or so (depending on how much free time I have), I&#8217;ll be reorganising things with a focus on aggregating all the snippets of &#8216;me&#8217; that are out on the interwebs into a single stream.&#160; I&#8217;ll still be posting longer posts and articles when I have something substantive to say, but will probably let Facebook, Twiiter, Last.FM, etc tell my story.</p>

<p>Hope you are all well!</p></p>

    <p><p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce my latest offering to the interwebs. If you&#8217;ve recently moved house or are otherwise in an unfamilar area, you may want to know where the nearest shops are; well <a href='http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk'>http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk</a> can answer that question for you. At the moment, just the big four supermarkets can be located, but I hope to redress that as time goes by. I in no way endorse any store represented on the site, and provide this service &#8220;as is&#8221;. Any thoughts/suggestions are very much welcome.</p></p>
