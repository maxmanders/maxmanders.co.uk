    <p><p>And so the new year is upon us.&#160; Whether it&#8217;s <em>twenty-ten</em> or <em>two thousand and ten</em> I don&#8217;t know, but in any case it seems obligatory in the blogosphere to reflect on the year gone by and to expound upon the year to come.</p>

<p>A year ago I wrote a similarly themed post in which I set out a number of so called <em>resolutions</em> that I had the best of intentions of keeping.&#160; Unsurprisingly, I didn&#8217;t manage to keep any of them.&#160; I still smoke, although I can honestly say that I smoke less than I did this time last year; I doubt very much that I have lost any weight in fact quite the opposite; my caffeine intake has probably risen and I think I&#8217;ve only played the trombone while severely inebriated.&#160; If the object of a new years resolution is to endeavour to do the exact opposite, then I have most certainly succeeded in keeping all of last years resolutions.</p>

<p>So moving forward to the year ahead, I will be trying my utmost to fulfil the resolutions of last year whilst in addition trying to be generally less grumpy and trying not to succumb to stressful situations.</p>

<p>And without a doubt. the most exciting event I have to look forward to in the coming year is my being married to my fiance&#233; Jo.&#160; All in all I&#8217;m hopeful that 2010 will be a great year!</p></p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">December 04, 2009</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>I realise that supermarkets have to cover their own backs with respect to the sale of alcohol and tobacco. However the supermarket policies and the law informing those policies seem to differ drastically. Retailers aren&#8217;t legally allowed to sell alcohol or tobacco to persons under the age of eighteen. Most supermarket policies require that their staff ask for ID of any persons who look under the age of 25.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t yet been abroad, and I don&#8217;t drive. As such I do not posses either of the forms of ID that retailers consider adequate to prove who I am, and my age. I do have a birth certificate, which when produced in conjunction with credit/debit cards <em>might</em> be enough to convince a sympathetic checkout clerk that I am who I say I am, and am indeed aged over 18.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t think I look younger than 18! &#160;I have a full beard and a hair line that is receding&#160;embarrassingly&#160;rapidly. &#160;In fact, the majority of checkout clerks who question my age are pimply youths who hardly look old enough to be custodians of the cigarettes and booze I am old and&#160;ugly&#160;enough to choose to buy for myself.</p>

<p>Since I have been deprived of cigarettes and almost deprived of the beer I have been looking forward to relaxing with all day, I take justified objection to what feels like discrimination. &#160;A checkout clerk can refuse to serve me because they decide on a whim that I look younger than 25; seven years older than legally required, and I am unable to prove my age because I neither drive nor have been abroad.</p>

<p>In summary - BLARGH!</p></p>

    <p><p>I&#8217;ve been writing a small Python/Tk application and until recently was having trouble with menu item callback functions.&#160; I have a series of menu items, all of which do much the same thing, but within the context of an item-specific ID.&#160; Therefore it would make sense to have a generic function that takes some parameter to determine what to do.</p>

    <p><p>Smoking is bad. I realise that. But like any addiction, no amount of rational discourse will disuade me from enjoying a cigarette. Believe me, I&#8217;m very much aware of the arguements against it.</p>

<p>However, smokers are not carriers of some hideous contagion. If I want to smoke while waiting for a bus, I&#8217;ll respectful head to the end of the queue away from others. You don&#8217;t want to be bothered by my smoke, and I respect that. I do however object to Joe Public ignoring the ample space in front of me and queuing as only the British can, behind me; glaring at me all the while for polluting their personal space. If you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t hover beside me when there is plenty of room for you to breathe the air that is polluted only by our own industrial and other emissions.</p>

<p>Here endeth the rant. If you can find it in yourself to not voluntarily subject yourself to passive smoking and then vilify me as if I made you do it, I would be most apreciative.</p></p>

    <p><p>I&#8217;ve been somewhat remiss in updating this site in recent times. This has largely been due to my being incredibly busy. Since saying farewell to <a href='http://www.valleyt.co.uk'>Valley Technology</a>, I&#8217;ve joined <a href='http://www.dietchef.co.uk'>Diet Chef</a> as their web developer and general IT jack-of-all-trades. I&#8217;m pleased to say I&#8217;m enjoying the varied work, but look forward to finding time for some more personal projects, including further developing <a href='http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk'>"Where are the shops?"</a>.</p>

<p>I also think, due to the ubiquity of various social networks (vis-a-vis Facebook, Twitter et al.) and the iPhone, I tend to blog less, favouring to send updates to a number of social networking sites.&#160; This has lead me to conclude that the present incarnation of the site isn&#8217;t really working for me.&#160; Over the next month or so (depending on how much free time I have), I&#8217;ll be reorganising things with a focus on aggregating all the snippets of &#8216;me&#8217; that are out on the interwebs into a single stream.&#160; I&#8217;ll still be posting longer posts and articles when I have something substantive to say, but will probably let Facebook, Twiiter, Last.FM, etc tell my story.</p>

<p>Hope you are all well!</p></p>
