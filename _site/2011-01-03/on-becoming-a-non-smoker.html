<title>On Becoming a Non-Smoker - Max Manders</title>
        
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="description" content="Another year begins and so too does a time of introspection and self-analysis.&#160; It&#8217;s traditional to make lists of resolutions, and while I plan on resolving to change a number of bad habits and adopting new and better ones, smoking has proved year-on-year to be the one resolution that doesn&#8217;t stick.&#160; This year that stops.

I&#8217;ve smoked for about ten years, averaging 20 cigarettes per-day.&#160; Now it&#8217;s time for me to take control of my life and stop smoking once and for all.&#160; There will always be stressful situations, anxious moments that would previously have necessitated the lighting of a cigarette.&#160; Past attempts to quit generally failed due to lack of resolve, always finding an excuse to have &#8216;just one more cigarette&#8217;.&#160; On the recommendation of numerous ex-smokers I downloaded &#8221;REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a title=&quot;&quot;Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot; by Allen Carr via Amazon.co.uk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0140277633&quot;&gt;Allen Carr&apos;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking&lt;/a&gt;&#8221; on my Kindle.

I noticed a number of repeated phrases and ideas throughout the book: perhaps this repetition was meant to be perceived on a subconscious level, but I was very much aware of what felt like insidious suggestion being snuck in under the radar.&#160; Having said that, the main themes and ideas in the book didn&#8217;t focus on the more traditional &#8216;will-power required&#8217; approach, nor did the book rely on health or monetary scare tactics.&#160; Instead it felt like having a long discussion with an ex-smoker who simply validated and confirmed various feelings and thoughts that were already playing on my mind.&#160; Having someone who has been in a similar situation acknowledge these things is perhaps the nudge that I needed, to confirm what I already knew to be true and stop smoking for the right reasons.

It&#8217;s early days but I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ve had my last cigarette.&#160; There is no guarantee that this book will work for everyone, but I&#8217;d suggest that if you want to stop smoking you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose.&#160; If it doesn&#8217;t work you&#8217;re in no worse a position than you are in now!" />
