  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Our cat Ziggy likes to play with things, very random things (that&#8217;s her below; she&#8217;s a little larger now). For example, if we&#8217;ve had a bag of crisps, we&#8217;ll tie the bag into a knot and throw it on the floor for her to play with. We try and pick her &#8220;toys&#8221; up after her, but a few get through the net as she runs around with them in her mouth no doubt building a secret stash of them in a corner somewhere. Guess what - today I found that secret stash.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent some of this afternoon tinkering with my site layout and style, and became aware of a larger than normal concentration of these crisp packet knots in the office/guest bedroom.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Today I received the sad news from my parents that my dog Flint was put-down. Several years ago , a small piece of cartilage broke off of his spine and lodged itself in a vein. This caused a swelling that led to nerve damage in the surrounding area. He effectively wasn&#8217;t aware of where his legs were; although he had some feeling below the waist. Our vet had never heard of this happening twice in one dog, but as he was on the mend it happened again.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, he had further nerve damage, this time more severe. He lost all feeling below the waist. Due to the last incident his highly developed chest and shoulders allowed him to pull himself about the house, but he was unaware of going to the toilet inside, and getting him outside involved a crude sling/wheelbarrow affair with a towel slung under his stomach.</p>

    <p><p>I&#8217;ve just upgraded to Wordpress 2.1 and I have to say the process couldn&#8217;t have gone more smoothly.? I backed up my entire database using phpMyAdmin; took a copy of my wordpress directory structure; uploaded the new files; copied wp-confog.php, .htaccess, wp-content back; ran the upgrade script and that was all there was to it.? I was expecting some troubles but there were none to speak of!? Well done Wordpress.</p></p>
