<p>This has changed dramatically. With the introduction of a standard Document Object Model (DOM) that is supported across a wide range of browsers, it&#8217;s far easier to write cross-browser compatible, accessible and usable DOM scripts. This book brought me up to speed with the DOM and what I can achieve with it. Written to be easily accessible to both the seasoned web designer/developer and the beginner, Jeremy Keith has produced a smashing insight into modern JavaScript techniques. The book concludes with a brief introduction into the now popular technique of using asynchronous javascript methods that is AJAX. I look forward to reading his latest book <a href='http://www.bulletproofajax.com/' title='Bulletproof AJAX'>Bulletproof AJAX</a> later on in the year.</p>

<p>I have previously read Andy Budd&#8217;s excellent <a href='http://www.cssmastery.com/' title='CSS Mastery'>CSS Mastery</a> which was equally well written, and presented a clear view of modern CSS to both the novice and experienced designer/developer. Friends of Ed certainly publish some good reads!</p></p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Our cat Ziggy likes to play with things, very random things (that&#8217;s her below; she&#8217;s a little larger now). For example, if we&#8217;ve had a bag of crisps, we&#8217;ll tie the bag into a knot and throw it on the floor for her to play with. We try and pick her &#8220;toys&#8221; up after her, but a few get through the net as she runs around with them in her mouth no doubt building a secret stash of them in a corner somewhere. Guess what - today I found that secret stash.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent some of this afternoon tinkering with my site layout and style, and became aware of a larger than normal concentration of these crisp packet knots in the office/guest bedroom.</p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">January 26, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Today I received the sad news from my parents that my dog Flint was put-down. Several years ago , a small piece of cartilage broke off of his spine and lodged itself in a vein. This caused a swelling that led to nerve damage in the surrounding area. He effectively wasn&#8217;t aware of where his legs were; although he had some feeling below the waist. Our vet had never heard of this happening twice in one dog, but as he was on the mend it happened again.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, he had further nerve damage, this time more severe. He lost all feeling below the waist. Due to the last incident his highly developed chest and shoulders allowed him to pull himself about the house, but he was unaware of going to the toilet inside, and getting him outside involved a crude sling/wheelbarrow affair with a towel slung under his stomach.</p>
