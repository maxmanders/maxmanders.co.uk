  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>As you can see from my previous post, my first attempt at writing a Wordpress Plugin was a success. This plugin is very simple and allows the user to embed a YouTube video into their post. The main function calls a callback function that replaces every occurrence of the tag &#8220;youtube&#8221; video_iduotes) with a flash video corresponding to the video_id parameter.</p>

<p>Just paste the code below into a file called &#8216;youtube.php&#8217; in your wp-content/plugins directory. You should then be able to activate it via the Plugins admin option. Once activated, you can place a YouTube video in your post by going to code-view and inserting &#8220;youtube&#8221; video_idhe quotes). The video_id parameter is the &#8216;v&#8217; parameter in a YouTube URL. In the example below, the URL is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL4L4Uv5rf0. Therefore, the video_id parameter should be lL4L4Uv5rf0. In the code below, you will need to remove the quotes around the word &#8220;youtube&#8221; in the regex on line 5, I had to put these in to display the code without it interpreting the tag&#8230; it&#8217;s a work in progress! <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;</pre></p>

<p>define(&#8220;YOUTUBE_WIDTH&#8221;, 425); define(&#8220;YOUTUBE_HEIGHT&#8221;, 350); define(&#8220;YOUTUBE_TAG&#8221;, &#8220;/<span>&#8220;youtube&#8221; (<span><span>:print:</span></span>+)</span>/&#8221;); define(&#8220;YOUTUBE_LINK&#8221;, &#8221;<object width='\' type='\' data='\' height='\'>
<param value='\' name='\' /></object>&#8221;);</p>

<p>function youtube_plugin_cb($match) { $html = YOUTUBE_LINK; $html = str_replace(&#8220;###YOUTUBE_ID###&#8221;, $match<span>1</span>, $html); return ($html); }</p>

<p>function youtube_plugin($content) { return (preg_replace_callback(YOUTUBE_TAG, &#8216;youtube_plugin_cb&#8217;, $content)); }</p>

<p>add_filter(&#8216;the_content&#8217;, &#8216;youtube_plugin&#8217;); add_filter(&#8216;comment_text&#8217;, &#8216;youtube_plugin&#8217;);</p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">August 16, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>My work has recently taken a departure from the usual web development as I&#8217;ve been &#8220;borrowed&#8221; by the other development team to help out with a Java project. Now, my Java is reasonable sound but yesterday I came across a curious situation involving passing about the current object.</p>

<p>In common with a lot of languages, the current object is represented by the &#8216;this&#8217; keyword. I wanted to pass &#8216;this&#8217; to a static method of another class. Of course, I can&#8217;t refer to the object as &#8216;this&#8217; in the static method context as that would be ambiguous insofar as it could refer to the class with the static method I&#8217;m working with. This pattern is often used with callbacks where for example you might want to register a class with a particular listener objcet. To avoid confusion, I named the actual parameter in the static method <pre lang='Java'>that</pre> I assumed that I would reference the fields and methods of the object using <pre lang='Java'>that.someMethod()</pre> rather than <pre lang='Java'>this.someMethod()</pre> This is where the fun begins. Let&#8217;s call the original object <pre lang='Java'>SomeObject theObject</pre> and I want to call the static method <pre lang='Java'>SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that)</pre> I would call that method, from within theObject, using <pre lang='Java'>SomeClass.doStaticMethod(this)</pre> When in theObject, I have access to private fields and methods since private fields and methods are within scope. I assumed the same would be true when I passed &#8220;theObject&#8221; as &#8220;this&#8221; to &#8220;SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that)&#8221;. However, when I actually try to access private fields such as &#8220;that.privateField&#8221;, it would appear that I no longer have access. I could create appropriate accessor methods, but that would defeat the idea of encapsulation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas? Am I missing some fundamental (and so obvious I missed it) rule of scope or object passing?</p></p>

  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="/2007/08/15/symfony-woes.html" title="Symfony Woes">Symfony Woes</a></h3>
  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">August 15, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>I&#8217;ve finally found time to start investigating some other PHP frameworks, and after some brief research I decided to start off with <a href='http://www.symfony-project.com'>Symfony</a>. All is going well and so far I&#8217;m impressed with what Symfony can do compared with CakePHP&#8230; with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>I initially tried following the My First Project tutorial, but hit problems pretty quickly. It would seem that there was a problem with the PHP SQLite extension. The phpinfo() function verified that SQLite was indeed installed, but I couldn&#8217;t get any further on that trail. After reading a number of forum posts on the issue, it became apparent I should recompile Apache and PHP. I&#8217;m still not that confident with Linux to do that so I left it at that.</p>

<p>Then I followed the Askeet tutorial with more success as this tutorial uses MySQL rather than SQLite. However, I can&#8217;t get the URL rewriting to work as it should. I&#8217;ve checked my Apache configuration, the .htacces file and still no luck. If I load http://<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;project&gt;/question I get a 404 error.  If I load http://&lt;project&gt;/index.php/question or http://&lt;project&gt;/frontend_dev.php/question all is well.  I&apos;ll press on with this tutorial until I hit a road block, but this is really bugging me.  Again, a few forum posts suggest recompiling Apache and PHP.  However, the extensions that should be included in the new build are already present according to phpinfo().</pre></p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently running Fedora 7 which installs Apache and PHP in its own odd way. Perhaps I should start from scratch by removing Apache and PHP with yum and compiling both from source. Although as I said I&#8217;m kind of reluctant to do that. If anyone has any ideas - let me know!</p></p>
