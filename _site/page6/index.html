    <p><p>After a little hard work, I&#8217;m releasing my attempt to address the shortfall in accurate UK geocoding services.&#160; Courtesy of open data provided by Ordnance Survey Open Click-Point, some sed, SQLite, PHP and YQL I&#8217;ve produced a REST API, and a YQL datatable.&#160; I&#8217;ve also written <a title='UK Geocoding' href='http://maxmanders.co.uk/uk-geocode/'>a more thorough account</a> of this by way of documenation.</p></p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">March 31, 2010</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>My todo list has been telling me to play with Yahoo&#8217;s <a title='YQL on YDN' href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/'>YQL</a> for far too long now, so last night I did something about it.&#160; YQL is a Yahoo SQL-like language that allows developers to easily aggregate data from various disparate data sources without having to go through the rigmarole of writing their own API.&#160; There is a large selection of base tables that allow the developer to work with e.g. <a href='http://www.flickr.com'>Flickr</a> or <a href='http://www.upcoming.org'>Upcoming</a>.&#160; There is also a community contributed selection of tables (see <a href='http://datatables.org'>datatables.org</a>).&#160; You can contribute to the project by forking the GitHub project and sending a pull request once you&#8217;ve committed changed to your tree.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s exactly what I did last night.&#160; I did some digging and found the UK government&#8217;s data source for nutritional information, the <a title='Composition of Foods' href='http://www.food.gov.uk/science/dietarysurveys/dietsurveys/'>"Composition of Foods" report</a>.&#160; To use the data, I had to apply for a free <a title='OPSI Click Use Licensing' href='http://www.opsi.gov.uk/click-use/index'>Click-Use license</a>.&#160; I didn&#8217;t have to specify what data I was using or how I was going to use it; it seemed more the case that I had to have my name added to a list of people who use government data in some way, shape or form.&#160; Once I&#8217;d munged the data a bit, I created a CSV, and corresponding XML file as described by the DataTables documentation.</p>

<p>You can use my DataTable by querying YQL (or in the YQL-console) like this for example: <pre class='brush:sql'>use "http://maxmanders.co.uk/lab/nutritionals/nutritionals.xml";
select * from nutritionals where name = 'banana';</pre></p></p>

    <p><p>Whether it&#8217;s because yesterday was Blue Monday, or because tomorrow is my birthday I don&#8217;t know, but I feel a little melancholy of late. Not so much in general, but specifically with my hobby and career, web development.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love my job; as I have with every job I&#8217;ve had. The problem is that with any personal interest that becomes a career, web development has lost it&#8217;s shine a little lately. I&#8217;m certainly not going to do anything rash like change career I enjoy what I do too much. I just remember a time when I&#8217;d have a number of personal projects on the go, but when I get home from work now, the last thing I want to do is code.</p>

<p>I seem to have lost my creative inspiration and enthusiasm for what was my hobby but is now my career. Has anyone else been in a similar position of having the programmers equivalent of writer&#8217;s block? Any thoughts or suggestions as to how I can regain my enthusiasm on a postcard please. How do other coders come up with ideas for personal projects to keep them engaged and up to speed with the latest APIs and tools? Hopefully this can all be put down to seasonal blues and I&#8217;ll find inspiration soon.</p></p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>And so the new year is upon us.&#160; Whether it&#8217;s <em>twenty-ten</em> or <em>two thousand and ten</em> I don&#8217;t know, but in any case it seems obligatory in the blogosphere to reflect on the year gone by and to expound upon the year to come.</p>

<p>A year ago I wrote a similarly themed post in which I set out a number of so called <em>resolutions</em> that I had the best of intentions of keeping.&#160; Unsurprisingly, I didn&#8217;t manage to keep any of them.&#160; I still smoke, although I can honestly say that I smoke less than I did this time last year; I doubt very much that I have lost any weight in fact quite the opposite; my caffeine intake has probably risen and I think I&#8217;ve only played the trombone while severely inebriated.&#160; If the object of a new years resolution is to endeavour to do the exact opposite, then I have most certainly succeeded in keeping all of last years resolutions.</p>

<p>So moving forward to the year ahead, I will be trying my utmost to fulfil the resolutions of last year whilst in addition trying to be generally less grumpy and trying not to succumb to stressful situations.</p>

<p>And without a doubt. the most exciting event I have to look forward to in the coming year is my being married to my fiance&#233; Jo.&#160; All in all I&#8217;m hopeful that 2010 will be a great year!</p></p>

  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="/2009/12/04/do-you-have-any-id.html" title="Do You Have Any ID?">Do You Have Any ID?</a></h3>
  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">December 04, 2009</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>I realise that supermarkets have to cover their own backs with respect to the sale of alcohol and tobacco. However the supermarket policies and the law informing those policies seem to differ drastically. Retailers aren&#8217;t legally allowed to sell alcohol or tobacco to persons under the age of eighteen. Most supermarket policies require that their staff ask for ID of any persons who look under the age of 25.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t yet been abroad, and I don&#8217;t drive. As such I do not posses either of the forms of ID that retailers consider adequate to prove who I am, and my age. I do have a birth certificate, which when produced in conjunction with credit/debit cards <em>might</em> be enough to convince a sympathetic checkout clerk that I am who I say I am, and am indeed aged over 18.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t think I look younger than 18! &#160;I have a full beard and a hair line that is receding&#160;embarrassingly&#160;rapidly. &#160;In fact, the majority of checkout clerks who question my age are pimply youths who hardly look old enough to be custodians of the cigarettes and booze I am old and&#160;ugly&#160;enough to choose to buy for myself.</p>

<p>Since I have been deprived of cigarettes and almost deprived of the beer I have been looking forward to relaxing with all day, I take justified objection to what feels like discrimination. &#160;A checkout clerk can refuse to serve me because they decide on a whim that I look younger than 25; seven years older than legally required, and I am unable to prove my age because I neither drive nor have been abroad.</p>

<p>In summary - BLARGH!</p></p>
