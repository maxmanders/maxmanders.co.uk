    <p><p>By my reckoning, my current contract is nearly up which means I should be eligible for a free phone upgrade.&#194;&#160; I phoned a week ago to find out if that was the case and was told that yes, my contract was due for renewal in a few months so I could renew it and get a free phone upgrade on 15 November.</p>

<p>I phoned up earlier today to try and arrange this, and was told that I would have to pay &#194;&#163;150 for the phone I wanted (the Nokia N95) since my contract was apparently due for renewal in August of next year.&#194;&#160; Contrary to my memory and my phone bill, Orange insisted that my contract was for two years.&#194;&#160; In order to get out of this I would need to buy out the contract or go back to the shop I originally purchased the phone from and get written confirmation of my contract period.</p>

<p>This would be pointless.&#194;&#160; The only signed document I have was for the initial 12 month contract over three years ago.&#194;&#160; Since then all renewals and upgrades have been done through the Orange web site.&#194;&#160; Two of the three representatives I spoke to were most unhelpful and bordering on being down right rude.&#194;&#160; However, I have been a loyal Orange customer (both PAYG and contract) for over five years now and for the most part the customer service has been fine.&#194;&#160; After 40 minutes of what seemed like haggling on the phone we eventually reached a compromise.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this experience has left me disappointed with Orange and I shall have to seriously consider switching providers should this performance be repeated in the future.</p></p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">November 19, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>As part of my birthday present to my Jo, I took her to see <a title='The New Pornographers website' href='http://www.thenewpornographers.com/'>The New Pornographers</a> at <a title='Oran Mor, Glasgow' href='http://www.oran-mor.co.uk/'>Oran Mor</a> in Glasgow on Sunday night.&#194;&#160; I saw Neko Case there last year on Jo&#8217;s birthday and it is a fantastic venue.&#194;&#160; It&#8217;s not too large and the sounds is brilliant.</p>

<p>This was my first time seeing The New Pornographers live and I certainly wasn&#8217;t disappointed.&#194;&#160; Jo saw them a few years ago, but unfortunately Neko didn&#8217;t join the band on either occasion.&#194;&#160; This meant they didn&#8217;t perform &#8220;Fail Safe&#8221;, one of my favourite tracks from the new <a title='Challenger at Amazon.co.uk' href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Challengers-New-Pornographers/dp/B000S9KSC8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1195504846&amp;sr=8-1'>Challengers</a> album (as Neko and Kathryn perform wonderful harmonies on this track).&#194;&#160; Nonetheless I enjoyed the concert very much!</p>

<p>There was a good mix of the old and new, although no sneak previews of upcoming material.&#194;&#160; They performed a number of tracks from their latest album, as well as a great selection from previous albums: &#8220;Sing Me Spanish Techno&#8221;; &#8220;Bleeding Hearts Show&#8221; and &#8220;The Laws Have Changed&#8221; to name but a few.&#194;&#160; And just when we thought it was over, they came back on stage to do a good few songs for the encore.&#194;&#160; All in all, a brilliant concert even if Neko didn&#8217;t make an appearance!</p></p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">November 03, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>On Thursday 01 November I gave a brief talk titled &#8220;An Introduction to OpenID&#8221; at the monthly EdLUG meeting.&#194;&#160; The <a title='An Introduction to OpenID (Slides).' href='http://www.slideshare.net/maxmanders/an-introduction-to-openid'>slides for the talk</a> are available on Slideshare.&#194;&#160; It seemed to go well despite my fear of public speaking.&#194;&#160; A few questions were put to me; some of which I could answer.</p>

<p>The few I couldn&#8217;t answer were mainly regarding the specifics of the OpenID authentication process.&#194;&#160; Perhaps it was nerves, but in hindsight I realise I knew the answer all along.&#194;&#160; I was asked if OpenID could tie into Kerberos or PAM.&#194;&#160; This is really down to how one chooses to implement the standard.</p>

<p>The OpenID specifications state that at at some point authentication must be performed with the Identity Provider.&#194;&#160; However, the details of how this authentication must be performed are purposefully not specified and instead left up to the implementor.&#194;&#160; So in answer to the questions, yes you can use Kerberos or PAM in the authentication process, but it&#8217;s up to&#194;&#160; you to tie it all together.&#194;&#160; In fact, traditional username/password combinations need not be used.&#194;&#160; If one so chooses secure fobs or biometrics could indeed be used; it&#8217;s up to you!</p></p>
