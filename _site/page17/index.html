    <p><p>My work has recently taken a departure from the usual web development as I've been "borrowed" by the other development team to help out with a Java project.  Now, my Java is reasonable sound but yesterday I came across a curious situation involving passing about the current object.</p>

<p>In common with a lot of languages, the current object is represented by the 'this' keyword.  I wanted to pass 'this' to a static method of another class.  Of course, I can't refer to the object as 'this' in the static method context as that would be ambiguous insofar as it could refer to the class with the static method I'm working with.  This pattern is often used with callbacks where for example you might want to register a class with a particular listener objcet.  To avoid confusion, I named the actual parameter in the static method</p>

<pre lang="Java">that</pre>


<p>I assumed that I would reference the fields and methods of the object using</p>

<pre lang="Java">that.someMethod()</pre>


<p>rather than</p>

<pre lang="Java">this.someMethod()</pre>


<p>This is where the fun begins.  Let's call the original object</p>

<pre lang="Java">SomeObject theObject</pre>


<p>and I want to call the static method</p>

<pre lang="Java">SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that)</pre>


<p>I would call that method, from within theObject, using</p>

<pre lang="Java">SomeClass.doStaticMethod(this)</pre>


<p>When in theObject, I have access to private fields and methods since private fields and methods are within scope.  I assumed the same would be true when I passed "theObject" as "this" to "SomeClass.doStaticMethod(SomeObject that)".  However, when I actually try to access private fields such as "that.privateField", it would appear that I no longer have access.  I could create appropriate accessor methods, but that would defeat the idea of encapsulation.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?  Am I missing some fundamental (and so obvious I missed it) rule of scope or object passing?</p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">August 15, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>I've finally found time to start investigating some other PHP frameworks, and after some brief research I decided to start off with <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com">Symfony</a>.  All is going well and so far I'm impressed with what Symfony can do compared with CakePHP... with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>I initially tried following the My First Project tutorial, but hit problems pretty quickly.  It would seem that there was a problem with the PHP SQLite extension.  The phpinfo() function verified that SQLite was indeed installed, but I couldn't get any further on that trail.  After reading a number of forum posts on the issue, it became apparent I should recompile Apache and PHP.  I'm still not that confident with Linux to do that so I left it at that.</p>

<p>Then I followed the Askeet tutorial with more success as this tutorial uses MySQL rather than SQLite.  However, I can't get the URL rewriting to work as it should.  I've checked my Apache configuration, the .htacces file and still no luck. If I load http://<project>/question I get a 404 error.  If I load http://<project>/index.php/question or http://<project>/frontend_dev.php/question all is well.  I'll press on with this tutorial until I hit a road block, but this is really bugging me.  Again, a few forum posts suggest recompiling Apache and PHP.  However, the extensions that should be included in the new build are already present according to phpinfo().</p>

<p>I'm currently running Fedora 7 which installs Apache and PHP in its own odd way.  Perhaps I should start from scratch by  removing Apache and PHP with yum and compiling both from source.  Although as I said I'm kind of reluctant to do that.  If anyone has any ideas - let me know!</p>

    <p><p>Up until recently my hosting was provided by Fasthosts.  For reasons that have nothing to do with the experience I have had with Fasthosts I have had to move to an alternative hosting provider.  After some research I opted to go with Hostgator's Baby plan. The features included with this hosting plan are excellent for the small fee of &Acirc;&pound;5.00 per month.   And the technical support is brilliant.  I initially had problems getting SSH access, but after raising the issue via the ticket system, I had SSH access within a few emails! </p>
