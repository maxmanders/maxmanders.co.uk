  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Another year begins and so too does a time of introspection and self-analysis.&nbsp; It's traditional to make lists of resolutions, and while I plan on resolving to change a number of bad habits and adopting new and better ones, smoking has proved year-on-year to be the one resolution that doesn't stick.&nbsp; This year that stops.</p>

<p>I've smoked for about ten years, averaging 20 cigarettes per-day.&nbsp; Now it's time for me to take control of my life and stop smoking once and for all.&nbsp; There will always be stressful situations, anxious moments that would previously have necessitated the lighting of a cigarette.&nbsp; Past attempts to quit generally failed due to lack of resolve, always finding an excuse to have 'just one more cigarette'.&nbsp; On the recommendation of numerous ex-smokers I downloaded "<a title=""Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr via Amazon.co.uk" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0140277633">Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking</a>" on my Kindle.</p>

<p>I noticed a number of repeated phrases and ideas throughout the book: perhaps this repetition was meant to be perceived on a subconscious level, but I was very much aware of what felt like insidious suggestion being snuck in under the radar.&nbsp; Having said that, the main themes and ideas in the book didn't focus on the more traditional 'will-power required' approach, nor did the book rely on health or monetary scare tactics.&nbsp; Instead it felt like having a long discussion with an ex-smoker who simply validated and confirmed various feelings and thoughts that were already playing on my mind.&nbsp; Having someone who has been in a similar situation acknowledge these things is perhaps the nudge that I needed, to confirm what I already knew to be true and stop smoking for the <em>right</em> reasons.</p>

<p>It's early days but I'm confident I've had my last cigarette.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that this book will work for everyone, but I'd suggest that if you want to stop smoking you've got nothing to lose.&nbsp; If it doesn't work you're in no worse a position than you are in now!</p>

    <p><p>Revision control systems serve their purpose well for managing codebases, but they can also be used to good effect for configuration management.&nbsp; I'll discuss how I've used Subversion to manage the configuration of my home directory.&nbsp; The same goal could probably be achieved just as easily with Git.&nbsp; While I use Git and Github for personal projects, I have employed this solution at work where we use Subversion.</p>

    <p><p>I ran into an interesting little subversion problem earlier.&nbsp; I was trying to commit a change, and the commit just seemed to hang indefinitely.&nbsp; I couldn't sent an interrupt, and eventually resorted to killing the process.&nbsp; I tried all sorts of command line options in case there was an authentication problem - with no luck.&nbsp; I then thought I had made a mistake when switching my working copy to a different branch.&nbsp; I checked the logs on the server to find nothing pertinent; it seemed as though svn didn't get as far as taking to the server.&nbsp; At a loss, I thought there was nothing for it but to run the command with strace.&nbsp; Bingo!</p>

<p>Strace showed that subversion reads from /dev/random as part of the commit, and that's where the problem seemed to be happening.&nbsp; After doing some research, I discovered that /dev/random generates random numbers using the so-called <em>entropy pool</em>.&nbsp; This <em>entropy pool</em> is just random bits of noise generated from things such as mouse movements, time between keystrokes and so on.&nbsp; For whatever reason, on the client server, this <em>entropy pool</em> was empty!&nbsp; Using /dev/random is cryptographically <em>more random</em> than using /dev/urandom; and /dev/random blocks when the <em>entropy pool</em> is empty, whereas /dev/urandom is non-blocking.&nbsp; Moving /dev/random to /dev/random.old and linking /dev/urandom to /dev/random solved the problem.&nbsp; There may be a better solution to this, and depending on your cryptographic requirements it might be better to find an alternative, but this did the trick for me.&nbsp; One svn commit later and all was well.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>I've had some exposure to database replication through PostgreSQL/Slony.  I'm reasonably familiar with master/slave replication but in the last few days I've had to get my hands dirty and grok multi-master replication with MySQL, specifically with two MySQL servers in mastermaster mode.  Although conceptually it's not a significant leap from simple master/slave replication the added layer of replication in both directions made my brain melt a little bit at first.  Now that I've got my head around as much as I need to, I'm writing this as a gentle reminder should replication screw up again!</p>

    <p><p>A month ago I handed in my resignation to Diet Chef, and this past month has certainly flown by.  Today I start a new job with Maglabs.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Diet Chef and will miss my friends there, and with any luck we'll keep in touch. I learned a lot about marketing at Diet Chef and it was a very different environment to that which I became accustomed to at Valley Technology; but different in a very positive way.</p>

<p>My time there made me realise that I'm very much a back-office PHP coder. I enjoyed the varied challenges there but my passion lies more with getting something awesome working well rather than making something look beautiful (in no way a criticism of my previous employer, far from it, I just want to be more focused in my work); I'm no designer although I definitely believe any design has to be functional and usable. I want my work playground to involve more complicated coding challenges, maybe mashing cool APIs together now and then.</p>

<p>With a wedding to Jo to save for and who knows what in the future I also have to be realistic and that unfortunately means being financially motivated as well as looking for the right career fit. I'm looking forward to being able to fulfil both these needs with Maglabs. With that I bid my friends and colleagues at Diet Chef farewell and the very best of luck and success in the future, while also hoping for the same for myself in the future.</p>
