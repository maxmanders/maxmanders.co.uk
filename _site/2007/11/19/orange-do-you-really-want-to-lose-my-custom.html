<title>Orange... do you really want to lose my custom? - Max Manders</title>
        
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
<meta name="description" content="By my reckoning, my current contract is nearly up which means I should be eligible for a free phone upgrade.&#194;&#160; I phoned a week ago to find out if that was the case and was told that yes, my contract was due for renewal in a few months so I could renew it and get a free phone upgrade on 15 November.

I phoned up earlier today to try and arrange this, and was told that I would have to pay &#194;&#163;150 for the phone I wanted (the Nokia N95) since my contract was apparently due for renewal in August of next year.&#194;&#160; Contrary to my memory and my phone bill, Orange insisted that my contract was for two years.&#194;&#160; In order to get out of this I would need to buy out the contract or go back to the shop I originally purchased the phone from and get written confirmation of my contract period.

This would be pointless.&#194;&#160; The only signed document I have was for the initial 12 month contract over three years ago.&#194;&#160; Since then all renewals and upgrades have been done through the Orange web site.&#194;&#160; Two of the three representatives I spoke to were most unhelpful and bordering on being down right rude.&#194;&#160; However, I have been a loyal Orange customer (both PAYG and contract) for over five years now and for the most part the customer service has been fine.&#194;&#160; After 40 minutes of what seemed like haggling on the phone we eventually reached a compromise.

Unfortunately this experience has left me disappointed with Orange and I shall have to seriously consider switching providers should this performance be repeated in the future." />
