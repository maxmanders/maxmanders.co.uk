    <p><p>It is with great sadness today that I say goodbye to our dog Honey.  She lived a long and full life but ultimately her age and the poor health that accompanies a dog of her years got the better of her; this afternoon she was put to sleep.?  I hope that she and Flint are together again in the doggy afterlife.</p>

    <p><p>Well it's <strong>Friday 13th</strong> April today - and I've never been one for superstition - but...</p>

<p>I started feeling ill earlier this week and this morning it peaked.  I phoned in sick to work.  Partly because I'm not up to going around in circles with XSLT and XSL-FO trying to make an XML document pretty whilst coughing my lungs up and having my head filled with illness induced concrete; partly because I didn't want to inflict this horrible cold on my colleagues.  It was a shame because I had a meeting scheduled today that I wanted to attend - never mind.</p>

<p>As if that weren't enough I eventually dragged myself out of bed to do some cleaning as my parents and sister are coming down tomorrow.  Started in the kitchen, moved onto the living room and thought I'd put a load of washing on. BIG MISTAKE.  It would appear there is a loose fitting in the plumbing under the sink.  I can't use the washing machine or sink unless I want a small lake in the middle of the kitchen floor.  Have to wait until Monday for a plumber to come around and sort it.</p>

<p>Things to do this weekend:- buy new underwear and clothes or go to a laundrette; become skilled at washing dishes in a basin without putting water over the edge, thus flooding kitchen.  Oh the joys!</p>

    <p><p>Well another April 1st has gone by and I was fooled in a pretty big way!  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200704/wcag_20_released_today/" title="WCAG2.0 Fool">Roger Johansson posted</a> that the W3 had announced WCAG2.0 was a Final Recommendation.  Of course it didn't occur to me for a moment what day it was.  And worse still - I checked the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="W3C">W3c</a> website - to find no news about it - even that didn't start ringing alarm bells!</p>

<p>Oh well - shame on me... how did you get on with April 1st!?</p>

    <p><p><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com" title="Sitepoint">Sitepoint</a> have another <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=463770" title="Competition Rules">competition</a> on the go.  The winner gets a copy of the new book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Beautiful-Web-Design/dp/0975841963/ref=pd_ka_1/026-9838655-5211652?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173992708&amp;sr=8-1" title="Principles of Beautiful Web Design">"Principles of Beautiful Web Design"</a>.  The competition involves using CSS to style some simple markup that serves as an <a href="http://www.pmob.co.uk/sitepoint-comp/sitepoint-principles.htm" title="Sitepoint Competition markup">advert for the book</a>.  Unfortunately the markup hooks available for use with CSS are somewhat lean.  I've given it a <a href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/sitepoint" title="My attempt at the Sitepoint Competition">shot</a>, as have <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=463769" title="Other Entries">others</a>.  Why don't you have a go -  you have until the 6th of April to enter as many entries as you like.  Happy coding!</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>Aaargh.  That's all I can say about the number 38 service of Lothian Buses.  Possibly <em>the</em> most inconsistent bus of all those that travel the roads of this planet (not that I ever use hyperbole - or litotes for that matter).  Granted, it is one of the few buses that serve both the Western General Hospital and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary at each terminus respectively.  However, if the bus requires extra time at either end to transfer the ill and infirm then please Lothian Buses, I implore you, lay on extra buses - double-deckers even (never a seat on this perpetually late bus), or alter the timetable accordingly.  The bus was half-an-hour overdue in which time I watched three 33s, two 25s, four 3s (two of which arrived at the same time) pass me - none of which were of any use.  Fate it would seem is not without a sense of irony; this "bus o' doom" also serves the new flat I'm moving to at the end of the month.  Thankfully there are a number of more reliable buses there!  Here endeth the rant.</p>
