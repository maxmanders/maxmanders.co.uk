    <p><p>I&#8217;m not one of the many ardent Microsoft haters that use Linux, and as such I&#8217;m quite open to taking full advantage of whatever software I can to get the job done, whether I&#8217;m in Linux or Windows. I really quite like Paint.Net which I&#8217;ve used on Windows as an alternative to Photoshop and the GIMP. You can now get Paint.Net on Linux courtesy of the Mono framework:</p>

    <p><p>As I mentioned in my last post, I have had issues getting Firebug working in Firefox 3.0b5.&#160; Unfortunately at the moment Firebug isn&#8217;t compatible with the beta release of Firefox 3.&#160; To be honest, I&#8217;m quite happy with Firefox 2.x.&#160; From what I&#8217;ve read, Firefox 3 is more stable and less memory-hungry that its predecessor, and it does look nice (especially so according to Mac users).&#160; Unfortunately, these benefits are outweighed by my love of the Firebug extension.&#160; It is, in my opinion, the best debug tool for web developers bar none.&#160; To that end, I&#8217;ve chosen to remove Firefox 3 (and all the bits and bobs that come with it) and install Firefox 2.</p>

<p>A few apt-gets later, I had got rid of Firefox-3 and related packages, and installed Firefox-2, symlinked to /usr/bin/firefox.&#160; However, Firefox-2 still used the profile created by Firefox-3 in my home directory.&#160; I started Firefox from the terminal, with the &#8216;-ProfileManager&#8217; switch.&#160; I created a new profile, renamed default, and renamed my new profile to default.&#160; I then copied my bookmarks and related data from the old profile directory to the new one.&#160; Once this was done, I started Firefox with my new default profile,&#160; installed my favourite plugins and all was good - Firebug now works like a dream!</p></p>

  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="/2008/04/26/hardy-upgrade.html" title="Hardy Upgrade">Hardy Upgrade</a></h3>
  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">April 26, 2008</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>The latest stable release of Ubuntu linux (Hardy Heron) was released this week, and having eagerly awaited its release I decided to upgrade my desktop and laptop from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04.&#160; I&#8217;m going to keep my server on 7.10 for the time being however.</p>

<p>The upgrade went surprisingly smoothly.&#160; It was just a matter of &#8216;sudo apt-get update&#8217;, &#8216;sudo apt-get upgrade&#8217; and &#8216;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&#8217;.&#160; After an hour or so, the installation was complete and I rebooted.</p>

<p>I had a few issues with both my laptop and desktop, but these were resolved fairly easily.&#160; The Realtek sound on my laptop was supported via linux-backports-modules-generic.&#160; This didn&#8217;t seem to be available in Hardy, and neither the old ALSA, nor the new Pulse Audio Server seemed to support my Realtek onboard audio.&#160; A bit of searching on the Realtek website revealed linux drivers, which I promptly downloaded, unzipped and installed.&#160; Success!</p>

<p>When my desktop came back up after the reboot, the keyboard seemed to have a delay of a number of seconds, and would intermittently behave as if a key had held down.&#160; Also, Gnome didn&#8217;t come up properly, with the desktop being black.&#160; I rebooted again and everthing seemed fine&#8230; for now.</p>

<p>Firefox 3.0b5 comed preinstalled with Hardy.&#160; Unfortunately, the brilliant Firebug web developer extension isn&#8217;t compatible with this version of Firefox.&#160; I hope that the final release of Firefox will fix this compatibility issue.&#160; For the time being, I will have to install Firefox 2.x to allow me to use Firebug.</p>

<p>In summary, I&#8217;m very impressed with how easy and smoothly the upgrade went.&#160; Aside from a few small issues everything worked fine after the upgrade, it&#8217;s just a shame about including a prerelease web browser in a LTS release of Ubuntu.&#160; Perhaps they should have stuck with Firefox 2.x until Mozilla officially released version 3 of their excellent browser.</p></p>
