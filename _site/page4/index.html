<p>Our flight was scheduled to leave Edinburgh at 13:50 BST, arriving at Paris Charles de Gaulle at 16:40 GMT+1. &#160;It was my first flight abroad, and Jo hadn&#8217;t been abroad since she was a lot younger. &#160;We were a little nervous about getting things right at the airports, and unfortunately things didn&#8217;t go quite as smoothly as we had hoped; neither the airport signs nor staff were particularly helpful for the first-time traveller. &#160;We&#8217;d gone through security: I had a rucksack and a small wheeled suitcase; Jo had her handbag and a small wheeled suitcase. </p>

    <p><p>May 28th 2011. &#160;A day I&#8217;ll never forget; the day Jo and I got married. &#160;It&#8217;s always difficult finding the time to write new posts, but I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t at the very least make sure I wrote something about, clich&#233; as it may be, the happiest day of my life. &#160;We&#8217;d originally planned the wedding for 10th October 2010: of course that date was nothing to do with the fact that 10-10-10 is easy to remember; not was it in any way related to the fact that 101010 in binary represents 42 in decimal &#8211; &#8220;the answer to life, the universe, and everything&#8221;! &#160;That date wasn&#8217;t to be, due in no small part to a severe lack of funds and planning. &#160;Fast forward to May 28th 2011 and having spent a not-exorbitant sum of money on eBay enjoyed a perfectly planned and executed wedding day in Edinburgh. &#160;The weather was even good to us - it only rained when we were inside! &#160;A massive thanks to Jo&#8217;s bridesmaids, Jess and Mip for supporting and helping her; my best man Sally for her support and help; my dad for doing a wonderful job of the photography and of course my beautiful wife Jo for doing me the greatest honour of marrying me!</p>

<p>I work&#160;predominantly&#160;with Linux and use <a href='http://www.virtualbox.org' target='_blank' title='Virtual Box'>Virtual Box</a> as my V12n application of choice. &#160;Later versions of Virtual Box support VPC&#8217;s VHD disk image format. &#160;This means it&#8217;s possible to run these VPC images under VirtualBox, but it involves downloading and extracting files from the win32 executables; downloading drivers for the ethernet adapter and other time consuming steps that I&#8217;d rather not repeat every time my IE VM expires. &#160;I&#8217;m a programmer, therefore I&#8217;m lazy and don&#8217;t like doing things more than once; I&#8217;d rather script something to do it for me. &#160;In keeping with this virtue, I&#8217;ve written <a href='http://maxmanders.co.uk/msie2vbox' title='msie2vbox'>msie2vbox</a> to automate this stuff for me. &#160;It&#8217;s on <a href='https://github.com/maxmanders/msie2vbox/' target='_blank' title='msie2vbox on Github'>Github</a> with a GPLv3 license. &#160;There&#8217;s some outstanding todo items but it does the job for me, and I thought it might be of use to others.</p></p>

    <p><p>Another year begins and so too does a time of introspection and self-analysis.&#160; It&#8217;s traditional to make lists of resolutions, and while I plan on resolving to change a number of bad habits and adopting new and better ones, smoking has proved year-on-year to be the one resolution that doesn&#8217;t stick.&#160; This year that stops.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve smoked for about ten years, averaging 20 cigarettes per-day.&#160; Now it&#8217;s time for me to take control of my life and stop smoking once and for all.&#160; There will always be stressful situations, anxious moments that would previously have necessitated the lighting of a cigarette.&#160; Past attempts to quit generally failed due to lack of resolve, always finding an excuse to have &#8216;just one more cigarette&#8217;.&#160; On the recommendation of numerous ex-smokers I downloaded &#8221;<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a title=&quot;&quot;Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot; by Allen Carr via Amazon.co.uk&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0140277633&quot;&gt;Allen Carr&apos;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking&lt;/a&gt;</pre>&#8221; on my Kindle.</p>

<p>I noticed a number of repeated phrases and ideas throughout the book: perhaps this repetition was meant to be perceived on a subconscious level, but I was very much aware of what felt like insidious suggestion being snuck in under the radar.&#160; Having said that, the main themes and ideas in the book didn&#8217;t focus on the more traditional &#8216;will-power required&#8217; approach, nor did the book rely on health or monetary scare tactics.&#160; Instead it felt like having a long discussion with an ex-smoker who simply validated and confirmed various feelings and thoughts that were already playing on my mind.&#160; Having someone who has been in a similar situation acknowledge these things is perhaps the nudge that I needed, to confirm what I already knew to be true and stop smoking for the <em>right</em> reasons.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s early days but I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;ve had my last cigarette.&#160; There is no guarantee that this book will work for everyone, but I&#8217;d suggest that if you want to stop smoking you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose.&#160; If it doesn&#8217;t work you&#8217;re in no worse a position than you are in now!</p></p>
