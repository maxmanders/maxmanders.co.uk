  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>The latest stable release of Ubuntu linux (Hardy Heron) was released this week, and having eagerly awaited its release I decided to upgrade my desktop and laptop from Ubuntu 7.10 to 8.04.&nbsp; I'm going to keep my server on 7.10 for the time being however.</p>

<p>The upgrade went surprisingly smoothly.&nbsp; It was just a matter of 'sudo apt-get update', 'sudo apt-get upgrade' and 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'.&nbsp; After an hour or so, the installation was complete and I rebooted.</p>

<p>I had a few issues with both my laptop and desktop, but these were resolved fairly easily.&nbsp; The Realtek sound on my laptop was supported via linux-backports-modules-generic.&nbsp; This didn't seem to be available in Hardy, and neither the old ALSA, nor the new Pulse Audio Server seemed to support my Realtek onboard audio.&nbsp; A bit of searching on the Realtek website revealed linux drivers, which I promptly downloaded, unzipped and installed.&nbsp; Success!</p>

<p>When my desktop came back up after the reboot, the keyboard seemed to have a delay of a number of seconds, and would intermittently behave as if a key had held down.&nbsp; Also, Gnome didn't come up properly, with the desktop being black.&nbsp; I rebooted again and everthing seemed fine... for now.</p>

<p>Firefox 3.0b5 comed preinstalled with Hardy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the brilliant Firebug web developer extension isn't compatible with this version of Firefox.&nbsp; I hope that the final release of Firefox will fix this compatibility issue.&nbsp; For the time being, I will have to install Firefox 2.x to allow me to use Firebug.</p>

<p>In summary, I'm very impressed with how easy and smoothly the upgrade went.&nbsp; Aside from a few small issues everything worked fine after the upgrade, it's just a shame about including a prerelease web browser in a LTS release of Ubuntu.&nbsp; Perhaps they should have stuck with Firefox 2.x until Mozilla officially released version 3 of their excellent browser.</p>

    I've finally decided to get a new monitor, a 22" Hyundai Widescreen.  It's brilliant!

    <p><p>I would expect that the Ctrl+Backspace key combination would behave in Firefox as it does in other GTK applications, and indeed Firefox under Win32.  The expected behavior is that Ctrl+Backspace will delete one word backwards from the cursor (more specifically it will delete backwards until a punctuation character).  However, when I use this combination in the Firefox address bar under Gutsy, the whole  URL is deleted.  After some digging I came up with a solution: add the following to the bottom of /etc/firefox/pref/firefox.js:</p>

<pre>
// Make Ctrl+Backspace behave as expected.
pref("layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation", true);</pre>


<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <p><p>I decided some time ago that I wasn't happy with the way this site looked.&nbsp; Unfortunately I haven't had much time to do anything about it.&nbsp; I've finally got around to making some changes, the most important of which you may notice is the minimalist design.&nbsp; I don't know if I plan to change this any time in the future, but for now it will do.</p>

<p>I've also tried to pull in some data from other services I use (perhaps not as frequently as I would like) such as Twitter, Facebook and Flickr.&nbsp; To that end, my recent Twitter tweets are now displayed, together with my Facebook status.&nbsp; I've also pulled in some random images from my public Flickr collection.</p>
