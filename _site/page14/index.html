    <p><p>It&#8217;s official; on Thursday 01 November, I will start my new job with Edinburgh based Valley Technology.&#194;&#160; Unfortunately that means saying goodbye to my friends at the Crown Office but with any luck I&#8217;ll still see them now and again.&#194;&#160; And talk about jumping in at the deep end&#8230; on my first day I&#8217;ll be giving a brief five minute talk on OpenID at the EdLUG meeting that evening.&#194;&#160; As crazy as it sounds I&#8217;m doing it mainly for my self-confidence; I&#8217;ve never been a fan of public speaking but with any luck this will help me improve.&#194;&#160; I&#8217;ll post the slides up when I&#8217;m done.</p></p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>As some of you might be aware, I have rencetly been having some problems with my web/development server. It&#8217;s a Fedora 7 machine with a LAMP install, Java 5 and a few other odds and ends, and although I appreciate that Fedora tends to be an experiment vehicle on which Redhat tests new bits-and-bobs I was a little put off when I discovered problems with my network after updating the kernel to 2.6.22.4.</p>

<p>Essentially, everything seemed to be working okay, but for some reason I couldn&#8217;t ping any other computer on the network from the web server; nor could I ping the web server from any other machine on the network. The eth0 interface was up; I could ping localhost, and the static IP address I&#8217;d assigned the NIC; the Ethernet cable was good (I tried two cables, both of which I was certain were good). However, the LED on the hub was constantly on for the web server connection, and &#8216;ethtool etho&#8217; indicated that there was no link.</p>

<p>After several days of trying to fix the problem, I tried building an older kernel to use. It was the first time I had tried this, and it all went well - however, this did not fix the problem. It would seem that my initial assessment that the kernel update was causing the problems was incorrect.</p>

<p>Then I came up with the solution. Prior to the problems, I had been using the onboard NIC, a SiS900 based interface. I disabled the onboard, and put in a PCI SiS900 based NIC. This solved the problem and all was well. I still can&#8217;t think what the problem was - and don&#8217;t have the expertise to go through the logs and reverse the updates. For some reason - beyond my ken - updating the system interfered with the onboard NIC, but a PCI NIC with the same chipset worked fine. It wasn&#8217;t the kernel because I reverted that to the version prior to the update.</p>

<p>All&#8217;s well that ends well as they say&#8230; I now have my web server up and running. Well, almost. I used to do a lot of coding and administration using FreeNX over SSH to get a desktop. FreeNX has now stopped working! I&#8217;ve won the battle, but still the war goes on!</p></p>
