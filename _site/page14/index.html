    <p><p>By my reckoning, my current contract is nearly up which means I should be eligible for a free phone upgrade.&Acirc;&nbsp; I phoned a week ago to find out if that was the case and was told that yes, my contract was due for renewal in a few months so I could renew it and get a free phone upgrade on 15 November.</p>

<p>I phoned up earlier today to try and arrange this, and was told that I would have to pay &Acirc;&pound;150 for the phone I wanted (the Nokia N95) since my contract was apparently due for renewal in August of next year.&Acirc;&nbsp; Contrary to my memory and my phone bill, Orange insisted that my contract was for two years.&Acirc;&nbsp; In order to get out of this I would need to buy out the contract or go back to the shop I originally purchased the phone from and get written confirmation of my contract period.</p>

<p>This would be pointless.&Acirc;&nbsp; The only signed document I have was for the initial 12 month contract over three years ago.&Acirc;&nbsp; Since then all renewals and upgrades have been done through the Orange web site.&Acirc;&nbsp; Two of the three representatives I spoke to were most unhelpful and bordering on being down right rude.&Acirc;&nbsp; However, I have been a loyal Orange customer (both PAYG and contract) for over five years now and for the most part the customer service has been fine.&Acirc;&nbsp; After 40 minutes of what seemed like haggling on the phone we eventually reached a compromise.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this experience has left me disappointed with Orange and I shall have to seriously consider switching providers should this performance be repeated in the future.</p>

    <p><p>As part of my birthday present to my Jo, I took her to see <a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/" title="The New Pornographers website">The New Pornographers</a> at <a href="http://www.oran-mor.co.uk/" title="Oran Mor, Glasgow">Oran Mor</a> in Glasgow on Sunday night.&Acirc;&nbsp; I saw Neko Case there last year on Jo's birthday and it is a fantastic venue.&Acirc;&nbsp; It's not too large and the sounds is brilliant.</p>

<p>This was my first time seeing The New Pornographers live and I certainly wasn't disappointed.&Acirc;&nbsp; Jo saw them a few years ago, but unfortunately Neko didn't join the band on either occasion.&Acirc;&nbsp; This meant they didn't perform "Fail Safe", one of my favourite tracks from the new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Challengers-New-Pornographers/dp/B000S9KSC8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1195504846&amp;sr=8-1" title="Challenger at Amazon.co.uk">Challengers</a> album (as Neko and Kathryn perform wonderful harmonies on this track).&Acirc;&nbsp; Nonetheless I enjoyed the concert very much!</p>

<p>There was a good mix of the old and new, although no sneak previews of upcoming material.&Acirc;&nbsp; They performed a number of tracks from their latest album, as well as a great selection from previous albums: "Sing Me Spanish Techno"; "Bleeding Hearts Show" and "The Laws Have Changed" to name but a few.&Acirc;&nbsp; And just when we thought it was over, they came back on stage to do a good few songs for the encore.&Acirc;&nbsp; All in all, a brilliant concert even if Neko didn't make an appearance!</p>

  <span class="post-date"><abbr class="published-on">November 03, 2007</abbr></span>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p><p>On Thursday 01 November I gave a brief talk titled "An Introduction to OpenID" at the monthly EdLUG meeting.&Acirc;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/maxmanders/an-introduction-to-openid" title="An Introduction to OpenID (Slides).">slides for the talk</a> are available on Slideshare.&Acirc;&nbsp; It seemed to go well despite my fear of public speaking.&Acirc;&nbsp; A few questions were put to me; some of which I could answer.</p>

<p>The few I couldn't answer were mainly regarding the specifics of the OpenID authentication process.&Acirc;&nbsp; Perhaps it was nerves, but in hindsight I realise I knew the answer all along.&Acirc;&nbsp; I was asked if OpenID could tie into Kerberos or PAM.&Acirc;&nbsp; This is really down to how one chooses to implement the standard.</p>

<p>The OpenID specifications state that at at some point authentication must be performed with the Identity Provider.&Acirc;&nbsp; However, the details of how this authentication must be performed are purposefully not specified and instead left up to the implementor.&Acirc;&nbsp; So in answer to the questions, yes you can use Kerberos or PAM in the authentication process, but it's up to&Acirc;&nbsp; you to tie it all together.&Acirc;&nbsp; In fact, traditional username/password combinations need not be used.&Acirc;&nbsp; If one so chooses secure fobs or biometrics could indeed be used; it's up to you!</p>
