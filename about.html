  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I live and work in <a title="Edinburgh on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland with my wife Jo and our two cats, Ziggy and Maggie. I work as a systems developer, and at present work for <a href="http://www.cloudreach.co.uk">Cloudreach</a> helping our customer's migrate to the cloud with AWS and Google, with a focus on a DevOps approach to scalable, automated managed services and infrastructure. My interests, both professionally and otherwise are varied, and I hope that this site will eventually reflect that. I have been using and working with the web for about 8 years. I started learning HTML back in 1995 so that I could have my own little piece of &#8220;cyberspace&#8221;.</p>
    <p>This developed over the years into a passion for the internet, and what it can offer. I started to learn JavaScript, and then PHP. As I learnt more about accessibility and usability I began to develop my CSS skills; creating tableless layouts and using CSS for all presentation aspects, leaving the markup semantic and clean.</p>
    <p>I continued to learn and here I am today. I've migrated to using Ruby as my language of choice, and regularly delve in to Chef.  I use (X)HTML and CSS to markup and design my sites; JavaScript to control client-side behaviour; and PHP as a server-side language combined with MySQL as my database of choice. I often dabble with Java, PL/SQL and various other technologies as jobs require.</p>
    <p>When I&#8217;m not designing or developing websites or scalable infrastructure to run them, I enjoy writing and talking about them. I also enjoy playing the guitar and <a title="Trombone on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombones">trombone</a>. I&#8217;ve recently taken up photography to some extent. I try to keep my digital camera with me when I&#8217;m out and about so I can snap anything that catches my eye&#8230; a work in progress so far! I&#8217;m no gourmet chef, but I enjoy cooking and am reasonably capable around the kitchen.</p>
    <p>I keep a <a href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cv-2012-06.pdf">copy of my CV </a> here as well.</p>
