  <h1>On Being Generally Anxious</h1>
  <time datetime=2016-09-05T00:00:00Z class="post-date">September 5, 2016</time>
  <p>I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD as it&rsquo;s often known. I can learn to cope better with it. I can take
medication to help with the symptoms. It&rsquo;s part of who I am. I&rsquo;m no different now that I&rsquo;ve written this, than I was
before. Though now I&rsquo;m able to put a label on it. Being able to label myself in that manner, is both a relief, and
itself a source of anxiety.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I took a day to work from home, as I often do. At some point in the afternoon I found myself staring
vacantly at a shell prompt, knowing what I needed to do, but utterly unable to do so. I couldn&rsquo;t. I was too preoccupied
with myriad other concerns. So preoccupied that I felt crippled; incapable of doing anything. I spoke to my wife, Jo,
about it. She said it sounded a lot like anxiety. On her advice, I made an appointment with the doctor. After a good
chat about this recent event, and how I felt more generally, and historically, the doctor was fairly confident in
diagnosing me as having GAD. She prescribed me an SSRI, Paroxetine (sometimes Paxil, or Seroxat) on a low dosage, with a
follow up review of its effects and the dosage, in a month. Thanks Jo, and the NHS.</p>
<p>Feeling a little shy, nervous or anxious from time to time is perfectly normal, and healthy. Anxiety is key to our
primitive fight-or-flight response. Having these feelings of anxiety almost all of the time, to the extent that they
interfere with every day life is, broadly speaking, Generalized Anxiety Disorder.</p>
<p>Anxiety is a common symptom in a number of mental illnesses, such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Social Anxiety,
Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, various phobias etc. GAD often involves a mix of other symptoms too, for
example sometimes some sort of obsessive, or compulsive behaviour; but perhaps not to the extent where a separate
diagnosis of OCD would be appropriate.</p>
<p>For those with GAD, it&rsquo;s often the case that the constant worrying and anxiety is over seemingly mundane things; a fact
only too well understood by the sufferer. Nevertheless, we can&rsquo;t help but worry. Try as we might, we can&rsquo;t relax, we
can&rsquo;t switch off. We know it&rsquo;s irrational, despite being rational beings.</p>
<p>Everybody who suffers from GAD is different, we have a different <em>recipe</em>, a different way it affects us. For me, it&rsquo;s
always been there, lurking below the surface, but now I have a name for it. A low humming of background noise,
constantly distracting and stealing focus.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea about my particular <em>recipe</em>.</p>
<p>I over-think and over-analyse everything, and I mean <em>everything</em>. I&rsquo;m constantly &lsquo;checking in&rsquo; with Jo to make sure
she&rsquo;s okay. Often to her frustration; it&rsquo;s like my brain isn&rsquo;t convinced everything is okay, and I&rsquo;ll keep asking. I
can&rsquo;t help it. While I&rsquo;m going about everyday life, my mind will jump from worry-topic to worry-topic, seemingly at
random. I might be thinking about a task at work, but then I lose focus because I <em>have</em> to think about a different task
at work. Then all the other tasks. None of which have any real urgency, but their very existence means they warrant my
attention. Part way through that, I&rsquo;ll get concerned about what might happen if any one of those things don&rsquo;t get
completed. All the while making sure that I don&rsquo;t miss anything else that I <em>have</em> to be aware of, and concerned about.
While this is happening, I might start to worry about the state of the garden, or whether the hall carpet needs
vacuuming. It probably does need vacuuming. In fact it definitely does need vacuuming. I should do that as soon as I get
home. Really, I should do it now. But I can&rsquo;t. I <em>need</em> to though. Now imagine this flow, about any and every arbitrary,
mundane, pointless concern that might pop into your mind. Oddly, for me, it&rsquo;s often the trivial things that get my
anxiety flaring up. A lot of people get terribly nervous about flying. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me, go figure!</p>
<p>However, airports, that&rsquo;s a different story. Airports, and generally large concentrations of people. Busy streets, like
Edinburgh during the Festival Fringe; busy, noisy pubs; music gigs, all get my heart pounding, and my internal body
temperature feeling like it&rsquo;s about to burst the mercury. Similarly, in social situations, large groups of people I
don&rsquo;t really know that well. I&rsquo;ll want an escape, or a way to quickly excuse myself if it all gets a bit much.</p>
<p>Discussions or interactions at work can often be challenging. I can be very self-conscious. Others' opinions matter a
great deal to me. The idea of offending someone, or someone having a negative opinion of me, really worries me. A lot.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m having a discussion about a code change, I&rsquo;ll often over think my response. Did I offend one of my colleagues, do
they think I&rsquo;m a dick? Are they judging me for getting it wrong? Did I get it right? Would they have done it better.
What if I&rsquo;d waited and written the code differently, would they have had a different response? Should I put my neck out
and say what I think? If I do, will I be wrong. Will they think I&rsquo;m a lesser engineer, or a moron, for having a
different, or contradictory opinion? What ifs&hellip; so many what ifs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have too many obsessive or compulsive behaviours. I don&rsquo;t <em>check</em> things to certain counts, as the media would
typically demonstrate as being how-this-OCD-thing-works. I&rsquo;ll pick the skin on my lips, often until they bleed. Towels
need to be folded and put away a particular way. The volume on the TV or the car radio needs to be set on an even
number. None of these things have any basis in rational thought. I don&rsquo;t do them because I&rsquo;m worried something terrible
will happen. But I need to do them nevertheless.</p>
<p>I like routine and order. If I&rsquo;m going somewhere, I need to know all the steps of how I&rsquo;ll get there. If I don&rsquo;t, I get
incredibly worried about what might go wrong. Perhaps my need for routine and order is a coping mechanism, that I&rsquo;ve
come to need to keep ideas clear in my head. I use David Allen&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">&ldquo;Getting Things
Done&rdquo;</a> methodology to try to keep my brain empty as much as possible.
I dump anything and everything I think of that may need some action. I review these various lists for things that I&rsquo;d
like to do, or that have a deadline, looking for the <em>next action</em>. Thi* helps a lot, but it&rsquo;s a double edge sword.
Counter intuitively to the way the methodology *should* work, I&rsquo;ll find myself worrying whether I have in fact added
something to a list. The lists are all massive, necessarily, as intended. This itself makes me get anxious, worrying
about all the things I have to do. I don&rsquo;t *have* to do them, but convincing myself otherwise is an uphill battle!</p>
<p>I know this is all very irrational. Try telling me not to worry though! It&rsquo;s like me telling you not to get hungry!
There&rsquo;s a common theme of what-ifs and uncontrollable worry over the trivial. Fortunately, I&rsquo;ve never had any full blown
panic attacks. Sure, I can get a bit breathy, heart pounding, sweaty - but never uncontrollably shaking, or vomiting. I
count my blessings.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague, Jim, has often said to me (quoting &lsquo;The Bunk&rsquo; in &lsquo;The Wire&rsquo;), &ldquo;&hellip;There you go. Givin' a fuck
when it ain&rsquo;t your turn to give a fuck&hellip;&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s right. Can&rsquo;t help myself. But whenever I hear that, I do have a little
chuckle to myself.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing this? Why not? I&rsquo;m normal. This is normal. I look and act mostly the same as anybody else you might
come across. You can&rsquo;t <em>see</em> GAD: things might look calm-ish on the surface, but there&rsquo;s a lot going on under the hood.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot less stigma around mental illness these days, and I&rsquo;d like that to continue. For those who know me well,
this is just another facet of who I am. It doesn&rsquo;t define me. A number of others in the tech industry have made great
strides in raising awareness of mental illness, and helping to educate others. Notably, <a href="https://funkatron.com/">Ed
Finkler</a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/funkatron">@funkatron</a>) though his <a href="https://osmihelp.org/">Open Sourcing Mental
Illness</a> campaign. I&rsquo;d like to do my bit to further that agenda of awareness, education, and
inclusion. I&rsquo;d like to help others understand that <em>normal</em> is relative.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. Now, I&rsquo;ll go and think about all the different, terrible ways that posting this might play out.</p>

sufferers would like you to know about it.</p>
