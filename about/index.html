  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I live and work in <a title="Edinburgh on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland with my wife Jo and our two cats, Ziggy and Maggie. I  work for <a href="http://www.cloudreach.co.uk">Cloudreach</a> as a systems developer in the NOC helping our customers migrate to the cloud with AWS and Google, with a focus on a DevOps approach to scalable, automated managed services and infrastructure. My interests, both professionally and otherwise are varied, and I hope that this site will eventually reflect that. I have been using and working with the web since the early 2000s.  I started learning HTML back in 1995 so that I could have my own little piece of "cyberspace", and my love of the web grew from there!</p>
    <p>This developed over the years into a passion for the internet, and what it can offer. I started to learn JavaScript, and then PHP. As I learnt more about accessibility and usability I began to develop my CSS skills; creating tableless layouts and using CSS for all presentation aspects, leaving the markup semantic and clean.</p>
    <p>Never being able to satisfy my curiosity, I dived into using and configuring Linux to run my own web server, and kept digging to learn all of the other tools and technologies I work with today.  I've migrated to using Ruby as my language of choice, and regularly work with Chef, AWS, Linux and Windows, Splunk and a range of other <em>DevOps</em> tools.  </p>
    <p>When I'm not designing or developing websites or scalable infrastructure to run them, I enjoy writing and talking about them. I also enjoy playing the guitar and <a title="Trombone on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trombones">trombone</a>.
    <p>I keep a <a href="/media/cv.pdf">copy of my CV </a> here as well.</p>
