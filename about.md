title: About
---
I live and work in [Edinburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), Scotland with my wife Jo, our two cats, Ziggy
and Maggie, and our hedgehog, Pickle.

I  work for [Current Health](https://currenthealth.com/) as Senior Operations Engineer, with a focus on a DevOps
approach to scalable, automated maintainable infrastructure.

My interests, both professionally and otherwise are varied, and I hope that this site will eventually reflect that. I
have been using and working with the web since the early 2000s.  I started learning HTML back in 1995 so that I could
have my own little piece of "cyberspace", and my love of the web grew from there!

This developed over the years into a passion for the internet, and what it can offer. I started to learn JavaScript, and
then PHP. As I learnt more about accessibility and usability I began to develop my CSS skills; creating tableless
layouts and using CSS for all presentation aspects, leaving the markup semantic and clean.

Never being able to satisfy my curiosity, I dived into using and configuring Linux to run my own web server, and kept
digging to learn all of the other tools and technologies I work with today.  I've migrated to using Ruby as my language
of choice, and regularly work with Chef, AWS, Linux and Windows, Splunk and a range of other DevOps tools.

When I'm not designing or developing websites or scalable infrastructure to run them, I enjoy writing and talking about
them. I also enjoy playing Trombone.

I keep a [copy of my CV](/public/cv.pdf) here as well.
