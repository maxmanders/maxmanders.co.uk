title: On Being Generally Anxious
layout: post
---

I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD as it's often known. I can learn to cope better with it. I can take
medication to help with the symptoms. It's part of who I am. I'm no different now that I've written this, than I was
before. Though now I'm able to put a label on it. Being able to label myself in that manner, is both a relief, and
itself a source of anxiety.

A few weeks ago, I took a day to work from home, as I often do. At some point in the afternoon I found myself staring
vacantly at a shell prompt, knowing what I needed to do, but utterly unable to do so. I couldn't. I was too preoccupied
with myriad other concerns. So preoccupied that I felt crippled; incapable of doing anything. I spoke to my wife, Jo,
about it. She said it sounded a lot like anxiety. On her advice, I made an appointment with the doctor. After a good
chat about this recent event, and how I felt more generally, and historically, the doctor was fairly confident in
diagnosing me as having GAD. She prescribed me an SSRI, Paroxetine (sometimes Paxil, or Seroxat) on a low dosage, with a
follow up review of its effects and the dosage, in a month. Thanks Jo, and the NHS.

Feeling a little shy, nervous or anxious from time to time is perfectly normal, and healthy. Anxiety is key to our
primitive fight-or-flight response. Having these feelings of anxiety almost all of the time, to the extent that they
interfere with every day life is, broadly speaking, Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

Anxiety is a common symptom in a number of mental illnesses, such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; Social Anxiety,
Depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, various phobias etc. GAD often involves a mix of other symptoms too, for
example sometimes some sort of obsessive, or compulsive behaviour; but perhaps not to the extent where a separate
diagnosis of OCD would be appropriate.

For those with GAD, it's often the case that the constant worrying and anxiety is over seemingly mundane things; a fact
only too well understood by the sufferer. Nevertheless, we can't help but worry. Try as we might, we can't relax, we
can't switch off. We know it's irrational, despite being rational beings.

Everybody who suffers from GAD is different, we have a different *recipe*, a different way it affects us. For me, it's
always been there, lurking below the surface, but now I have a name for it. A low humming of background noise,
constantly distracting and stealing focus.

Here's an idea about my particular *recipe*.

I over-think and over-analyse everything, and I mean *everything*. I'm constantly 'checking in' with Jo to make sure
she's okay. Often to her frustration; it's like my brain isn't convinced everything is okay, and I'll keep asking. I
can't help it. While I'm going about everyday life, my mind will jump from worry-topic to worry-topic, seemingly at
random. I might be thinking about a task at work, but then I lose focus because I *have* to think about a different task
at work. Then all the other tasks. None of which have any real urgency, but their very existence means they warrant my
attention. Part way through that, I'll get concerned about what might happen if any one of those things don't get
completed. All the while making sure that I don't miss anything else that I *have* to be aware of, and concerned about.
While this is happening, I might start to worry about the state of the garden, or whether the hall carpet needs
vacuuming. It probably does need vacuuming. In fact it definitely does need vacuuming. I should do that as soon as I get
home. Really, I should do it now. But I can't. I *need* to though. Now imagine this flow, about any and every arbitrary,
mundane, pointless concern that might pop into your mind. Oddly, for me, it's often the trivial things that get my
anxiety flaring up. A lot of people get terribly nervous about flying. It doesn't bother me, go figure!

However, airports, that's a different story. Airports, and generally large concentrations of people. Busy streets, like
Edinburgh during the Festival Fringe; busy, noisy pubs; music gigs, all get my heart pounding, and my internal body
temperature feeling like it's about to burst the mercury. Similarly, in social situations, large groups of people I
don't really know that well. I'll want an escape, or a way to quickly excuse myself if it all gets a bit much.

Discussions or interactions at work can often be challenging. I can be very self-conscious. Others' opinions matter a
great deal to me. The idea of offending someone, or someone having a negative opinion of me, really worries me. A lot.

If I'm having a discussion about a code change, I'll often over think my response. Did I offend one of my colleagues, do
they think I'm a dick? Are they judging me for getting it wrong? Did I get it right? Would they have done it better.
What if I'd waited and written the code differently, would they have had a different response? Should I put my neck out
and say what I think? If I do, will I be wrong. Will they think I'm a lesser engineer, or a moron, for having a
different, or contradictory opinion? What ifs... so many what ifs.

I don't have too many obsessive or compulsive behaviours. I don't *check* things to certain counts, as the media would
typically demonstrate as being how-this-OCD-thing-works. I'll pick the skin on my lips, often until they bleed. Towels
need to be folded and put away a particular way. The volume on the TV or the car radio needs to be set on an even
number. None of these things have any basis in rational thought. I don't do them because I'm worried something terrible
will happen. But I need to do them nevertheless.

I like routine and order. If I'm going somewhere, I need to know all the steps of how I'll get there. If I don't, I get
incredibly worried about what might go wrong. Perhaps my need for routine and order is a coping mechanism, that I've
come to need to keep ideas clear in my head. I use David Allen's ["Getting Things
Done"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) methodology to try to keep my brain empty as much as possible.
I dump anything and everything I think of that may need some action. I review these various lists for things that I'd
like to do, or that have a deadline, looking for the *next action*. Thi* helps a lot, but it's a double edge sword.
Counter intuitively to the way the methodology *should* work, I'll find myself worrying whether I have in fact added
something to a list. The lists are all massive, necessarily, as intended. This itself makes me get anxious, worrying
about all the things I have to do. I don't *have* to do them, but convincing myself otherwise is an uphill battle!

I know this is all very irrational. Try telling me not to worry though! It's like me telling you not to get hungry!
There's a common theme of what-ifs and uncontrollable worry over the trivial. Fortunately, I've never had any full blown
panic attacks. Sure, I can get a bit breathy, heart pounding, sweaty - but never uncontrollably shaking, or vomiting. I
count my blessings.

My friend and colleague, Jim, has often said to me (quoting 'The Bunk' in 'The Wire'), "...There you go. Givin' a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck...". He's right. Can't help myself. But whenever I hear that, I do have a little
chuckle to myself.

Why am I sharing this? Why not? I'm normal. This is normal. I look and act mostly the same as anybody else you might
come across. You can't _see_ GAD: things might look calm-ish on the surface, but there's a lot going on under the hood.

There's a lot less stigma around mental illness these days, and I'd like that to continue. For those who know me well,
this is just another facet of who I am. It doesn't define me. A number of others in the tech industry have made great
strides in raising awareness of mental illness, and helping to educate others. Notably, [Ed
Finkler](https://funkatron.com/)([@funkatron](https://twitter.com/funkatron)) though his [Open Sourcing Mental
Illness](https://osmihelp.org/) campaign. I'd like to do my bit to further that agenda of awareness, education, and
inclusion. I'd like to help others understand that _normal_ is relative.

Thank you for reading. Now, I'll go and think about all the different, terrible ways that posting this might play out.

Here are some links that I've found quite useful, that might give you some more ideas about GAD, what it's like, what we
sufferers would like you to know about it.
