After a little hard work, I'm releasing my attempt to address the shortfall in accurate UK geocoding services.&nbsp; Courtesy of open data provided by Ordnance Survey Open Click-Point, some sed, SQLite, PHP and YQL I've produced a REST API, and a YQL datatable.&nbsp; I've also written <a title="UK Geocoding" href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/uk-geocode/">a more thorough account</a> of this by way of documenation.
