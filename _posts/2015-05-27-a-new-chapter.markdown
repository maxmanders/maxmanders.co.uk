The cat's out of the bag and the dust has settled.  I'm moving on from
[Cloudreach](http://www.cloudreach.com); though not for any particularly negative reasons,
it was just the right time for me, for a number of reasons.  Cloudreach are continuing to
grow and are actively recruiting for a number of roles, so if you're interested in an
exciting, fast-paced operations role in an AWS certified Managed Services Partner, then
[look no further](https://boards.greenhouse.io/cloudreach/).

I've spent the last two and a half years with Cloudreach, both as an operations engineer,
and a *Cloud Leader* helping my colleagues Shona and Alberto, and our boss Jon, run an
operations team spanning both Edinburgh and Vancouver.  I've had a great time; learnt a
lot; had some ups and downs; but most importantly made some truly dear friends with whom
I hope to keep in touch.  Hopefully along the way I've managed to mentor and teach some
aspiring operations engineers.  That would be a nice bonus!

Over the last few months I've found myself increasingly conflicted between what I *need*
to do and what I *want* to do.  As with any rapidly growing company, there are often times
where these two goals are mutually exclusive.  It was a very difficult decision, and there
is no *right* time to make such a change, but I had to focus on what was right for me, and
that meant a change of direction; I suppose it's natural to feel like you're leaving
people in the lurch or letting people down.  I'm a hacker at heart: I like solving real
problems involving complex distributed applications running on Linux; I like working at a
terminal; I like tinkering with code to try to automate tasks, and myself, to redundancy!
To further that career path meant making some hard choices.  I also miss working on a
*product*.  Working as part of an operations team for a Managed Services Provider
certainly affords plenty of opportunity to work with a diverse range of customers and
platforms, but that necessarily makes it difficult to ever really fully understand the
end-to-end infrastructure and application architecture.  That understanding is something I
miss.

To scratch that itch, I'll be starting a new job as an operations engineer for
[FanDuel](http://www.fanduel.com) on the 8th of June.  FanDuel is the market leader in
one-day fantasy sports, predominantly focussing on US sports leagues such as NFL; NBA;
NHL etc.  It's a unique product in a growing market, and I'm looking forward to the
opportunity it'll give me to apply my experience and learn new skills.

So, to all my friends and colleagues at Cloudreach - all the very best, please do keep in
touch!  It's been a pleasure working with you all, and I hope our paths will cross in the
future.
