I'm a big fan of Wikis. I like the idea of being able to dump my brain somewhere that I can keep organised, and access anywhere. If I don't have to juggle something in my mind, it's one less thing for me to worry about. There are lots of applications out there that let you manage a list of tasks, todo lists etc., but I like the flexibility a Wiki affords me to readily organise larger amounts of information.

I've tried various web based solutions for the obvious benefit that I can access them everywhere, however since I spend a lot of my time in Vim, I wanted something that doesn't involve a browser, yet offers the same flexibility and access-everywhere (well, where there's Vim) that a web based wiki offers.

That's where <a title="Vimwiki" href="http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/">Vimwiki</a> comes in. Vimwik is a Vimball that, once installed, allows you to create linked documents using a similar syntax to Markdown, Restructed Text etc. By default, it creates a 'vimwiki' directory in your home directory. I simply moved that directory to my Dropbox and created a symlink to my home directory.

It also features commands to export one or all pages to linked, local HTML files and allows you to create multiple separate wikis if you want. If, like me, you're a fan of Vim and wikis, give it a shot!
