It is with great sadness today that I say goodbye to our dog Honey.  She lived a long and full life but ultimately her age and the poor health that accompanies a dog of her years got the better of her; this afternoon she was put to sleep.?  I hope that she and Flint are together again in the doggy afterlife.
