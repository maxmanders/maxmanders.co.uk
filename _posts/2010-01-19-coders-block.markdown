Whether it's because yesterday was Blue Monday, or because tomorrow is my birthday I don't know, but I feel a little melancholy of late.  Not so much in general, but specifically with my hobby and career, web development. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my job; as I have with every job I've had. The problem is that with any personal interest that becomes a career, web development has lost it's shine a little lately. I'm certainly not going to do anything rash like change career I enjoy what I do too much.  I just remember a time when I'd have a number of personal projects on the go, but when I get home from work now, the last thing I want to do is code.

I seem to have lost my creative inspiration and enthusiasm for what was my hobby but is now my career. Has anyone else been in a similar position of having the programmers equivalent of writer's block?  Any thoughts or suggestions as to how I can regain my enthusiasm on a postcard please.  How do other coders come up with ideas for personal projects to keep them engaged and up to speed with the latest APIs and tools? Hopefully this can all be put down to seasonal blues and I'll find inspiration soon.
