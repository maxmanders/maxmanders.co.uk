The conference will be covering the subject of progressive enhancement at Symposium Hall, part of the Royal College of Surgeons.  The conference is aimed at raising the profile of web development in Scotland and to act as a gateway to some of the leaders and thinkers of the web development industry.  This is a great idea as it's often difficult for web professionals in Scotland to make it to one day conferences down south and abroad.

I will be going and if you want to go, visit <a title="The Highland Fling" href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/</a> to find out more, and to join the mailing list to be alerted when tickets go on sale.
