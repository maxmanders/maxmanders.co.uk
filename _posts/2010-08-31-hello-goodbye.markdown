    "I&rsquo;m no designer although I definitely believe any design has to be functional and usable."
    
    Well said.
    
    A stunning website with bugs and vulnerabilities is useless. I would always give the priority to the structure and the security. 
    
    With regard to the design and the marketing aspect it has needed people dedicated to it.

A month ago I handed in my resignation to Diet Chef, and this past month has certainly flown by.  Today I start a new job with Maglabs.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Diet Chef and will miss my friends there, and with any luck we'll keep in touch. I learned a lot about marketing at Diet Chef and it was a very different environment to that which I became accustomed to at Valley Technology; but different in a very positive way.

My time there made me realise that I'm very much a back-office PHP coder. I enjoyed the varied challenges there but my passion lies more with getting something awesome working well rather than making something look beautiful (in no way a criticism of my previous employer, far from it, I just want to be more focused in my work); I'm no designer although I definitely believe any design has to be functional and usable. I want my work playground to involve more complicated coding challenges, maybe mashing cool APIs together now and then.

With a wedding to Jo to save for and who knows what in the future I also have to be realistic and that unfortunately means being financially motivated as well as looking for the right career fit. I'm looking forward to being able to fulfil both these needs with Maglabs. With that I bid my friends and colleagues at Diet Chef farewell and the very best of luck and success in the future, while also hoping for the same for myself in the future.
