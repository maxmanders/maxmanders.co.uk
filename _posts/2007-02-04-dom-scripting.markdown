excerpt: <img src="/media/dom_scripting.jpg" title="DOM Scripting" alt="DOM Scripting" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="10" /> Well I've just finished reading Jeremy Keith's <a href="http://www.domscripting.com/book/" title="DOM Scripting">DOM Scripting</a> and I have to say it's an excellent and informative read.  Like many web developers I haven't really gone near JavaScript for a long time.  Since the browser wars and the horrible poorly-written DHTML era of the interweb, I've shied away from JavaScript.  There were too many ways to do things that weren't supported across the various browsers of the time; and what was produced was by and large a hideous, obtrusive, inaccessible mess.

Well I've just finished reading Jeremy Keith's <a href="http://www.domscripting.com/book/" title="DOM Scripting">DOM Scripting</a> and I have to say it's an excellent and informative read.  Like many web developers I haven't really gone near JavaScript for a long time.  Since the browser wars and the horrible poorly-written DHTML era of the interweb, I've shied away from JavaScript.  There were too many ways to do things that weren't supported across the various browsers of the time; and what was produced was by and large a hideous, obtrusive, inaccessible mess.<!--more-->

This has changed dramatically.  With the introduction of a standard Document Object Model (DOM) that is supported across a wide range of browsers, it's far easier to write cross-browser compatible, accessible and usable DOM scripts.  This book brought me up to speed with the DOM and what I can achieve with it.  Written to be easily accessible to both the seasoned web designer/developer and the beginner, Jeremy Keith has produced a smashing insight into modern JavaScript techniques.  The book concludes with a brief introduction into the now popular technique of using asynchronous javascript methods that is AJAX.  I look forward to reading his latest book <a href="http://www.bulletproofajax.com/" title="Bulletproof AJAX">Bulletproof AJAX</a> later on in the year.

I have previously read Andy Budd's excellent <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/" title="CSS Mastery">CSS Mastery</a> which was equally well written, and presented a clear view of modern CSS to both the novice and experienced designer/developer. Friends of Ed certainly publish some good reads!
