Smoking is bad.  I realise that. But like any addiction, no amount of rational discourse will disuade me from enjoying a cigarette.  Believe me, I'm very much aware of the arguements against it.

However, smokers are not carriers of some hideous contagion. If I want to smoke while waiting for a bus, I'll respectful head to the end of the queue away from others. You don't want to be bothered by my smoke, and I respect that. I do however object to Joe Public ignoring the ample space in front of me and queuing as only the British can, behind me; glaring at me all the while for polluting their personal space. If you don't like it, don't hover beside me when there is plenty of room for you to breathe the air that is polluted only by our own industrial and other emissions.

Here endeth the rant. If you can find it in yourself to not voluntarily subject yourself to passive smoking and then vilify me as if I made you do it, I would be most apreciative.
