There are a number of things that I intend to do with this site eventually when I have some free time:
<ul>
	<li>replace Wordpress with a custom developed engine</li>
	<li>play with the Yahoo! APIs</li>
	<li><strike>add a proper "I Listen To" panel that uses last.fm APIs to pull out live data about what I listen to</strike></li>
	<li>incorporate my Flickr photos by writing a custom plugin that gets data from Flickr services</li>
</ul>
That's something for me to be getting on with!
