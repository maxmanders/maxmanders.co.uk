Happy New Year!

I'm not much of a 'New Years' person.  While I appreciate that Hogmanay is a big holiday for a lot of people, I'm not one of them.  I always feel that it is a holiday where you are expected to force yourself to have a good time for the sake of it.  Having said that, I did have a good Hogmanay this year!  Going hand in hand with my 'bah humbug' feeling of New Years, is my opinion of so called resolutions.

Rarely do people manage to stick to resolutions that they make at the beginning of the year, and I tend to make a point of not making resolutions because I'll just feel guilty when I inevitably break them.  Nonetheless, I am going to make a few this year that I will try very  hard not to break:
<ol>
	<li>Stop smoking</li>
	<li>Lose weight</li>
	<li>Play the trombone more</li>
	<li>Drink less coffee</li>
</ol>
Surely I can manage four things!  Although I don't hold out much hope for the first two... we'll see!
