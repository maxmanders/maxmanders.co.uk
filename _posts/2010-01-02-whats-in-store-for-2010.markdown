And so the new year is upon us.&nbsp; Whether it's <em>twenty-ten</em> or <em>two thousand and ten</em> I don't know, but in any case it seems obligatory in the blogosphere to reflect on the year gone by and to expound upon the year to come.

A year ago I wrote a similarly themed post in which I set out a number of so called <em>resolutions</em> that I had the best of intentions of keeping.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly, I didn't manage to keep any of them.&nbsp; I still smoke, although I can honestly say that I smoke less than I did this time last year; I doubt very much that I have lost any weight in fact quite the opposite; my caffeine intake has probably risen and I think I've only played the trombone while severely inebriated.&nbsp; If the object of a new years resolution is to endeavour to do the exact opposite, then I have most certainly succeeded in keeping all of last years resolutions.

So moving forward to the year ahead, I will be trying my utmost to fulfil the resolutions of last year whilst in addition trying to be generally less grumpy and trying not to succumb to stressful situations.

And without a doubt. the most exciting event I have to look forward to in the coming year is my being married to my fiance&eacute; Jo.&nbsp; All in all I'm hopeful that 2010 will be a great year!
