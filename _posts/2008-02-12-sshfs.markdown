If you don't want the trouble of configuring NFS or Samba, then sshfs is a good option.  sshfs (ssh File System) makes use of Fuse (File System in Userspace) to allow you to locally mount a directory that you have remote access to using ssh.  To install sshfs in Ubuntu use:

<code>sudo apt-get install sshfs
</code>
Once this is done, you will need to add yourself to the new group (fuse) that has been created:

<code>sudo adduser <user> fuse</code>

Create a local directory in which to mount your remote directory and make sure it is owned by you:
<code>
mkdir [-p] /path/to/directory
chown <user>.<group> /path/to/directory
</code>
Now you can mount your remote directory as follows:
<code>
sshfs <user>@<remote_host>:/path/to/directory/ /path/to/directory
</code>
