It's official; on Thursday 01 November, I will start my new job with Edinburgh based Valley Technology.&Acirc;&nbsp; Unfortunately that means saying goodbye to my friends at the Crown Office but with any luck I'll still see them now and again.&Acirc;&nbsp; And talk about jumping in at the deep end... on my first day I'll be giving a brief five minute talk on OpenID at the EdLUG meeting that evening.&Acirc;&nbsp; As crazy as it sounds I'm doing it mainly for my self-confidence; I've never been a fan of public speaking but with any luck this will help me improve.&Acirc;&nbsp; I'll post the slides up when I'm done.
