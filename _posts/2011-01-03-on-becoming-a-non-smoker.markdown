Another year begins and so too does a time of introspection and self-analysis.&nbsp; It's traditional to make lists of resolutions, and while I plan on resolving to change a number of bad habits and adopting new and better ones, smoking has proved year-on-year to be the one resolution that doesn't stick.&nbsp; This year that stops.

I've smoked for about ten years, averaging 20 cigarettes per-day.&nbsp; Now it's time for me to take control of my life and stop smoking once and for all.&nbsp; There will always be stressful situations, anxious moments that would previously have necessitated the lighting of a cigarette.&nbsp; Past attempts to quit generally failed due to lack of resolve, always finding an excuse to have 'just one more cigarette'.&nbsp; On the recommendation of numerous ex-smokers I downloaded "<a title=""Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr via Amazon.co.uk" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0140277633">Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking</a>" on my Kindle.

I noticed a number of repeated phrases and ideas throughout the book: perhaps this repetition was meant to be perceived on a subconscious level, but I was very much aware of what felt like insidious suggestion being snuck in under the radar.&nbsp; Having said that, the main themes and ideas in the book didn't focus on the more traditional 'will-power required' approach, nor did the book rely on health or monetary scare tactics.&nbsp; Instead it felt like having a long discussion with an ex-smoker who simply validated and confirmed various feelings and thoughts that were already playing on my mind.&nbsp; Having someone who has been in a similar situation acknowledge these things is perhaps the nudge that I needed, to confirm what I already knew to be true and stop smoking for the <em>right</em> reasons.

It's early days but I'm confident I've had my last cigarette.&nbsp; There is no guarantee that this book will work for everyone, but I'd suggest that if you want to stop smoking you've got nothing to lose.&nbsp; If it doesn't work you're in no worse a position than you are in now!
