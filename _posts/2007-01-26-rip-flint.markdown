    hi max, just logged on to your web site, fay told us about the piece on Flint. It was lovely to read your comments, and yes we still are missing him so much. We keep coming across things that we do  that he used to share with us, and he's not there! I was clearing the fallen branches from the back and throwing in the burn, and he wasn't there to chase them into the water, so sad!
    Dad says that you write better than you sound, ken!!!!!!! see you soon xxx

excerpt: Flint was a loving and friendly dog, and I've loved him from the minute we got him as a fluffy little puppy.

Today I received the sad news from my parents that my dog Flint was put-down.   Several years ago , a small piece of cartilage broke off of his spine and lodged itself in a vein.  This caused a swelling that led to nerve damage in the surrounding area.  He effectively wasn't aware of where his legs were; although he had some feeling below the waist. Our vet had never heard of this happening twice in one dog, but as he was on the mend it happened again.

In the last few weeks, he had further nerve damage, this time more severe.  He lost all feeling below the waist.  Due to the last incident his highly developed chest and shoulders allowed him to pull himself about the house, but he was unaware of going to the toilet inside, and getting him outside involved a crude sling/wheelbarrow affair with a towel slung under his stomach.<!--more-->

The look of shame and embarrassment on his face when he had to be lifted outside and cleaned up after was heart breaking.  Although the vet gave him medication to try and repair the damage his quality of life was seriously affected.  Thus the decision was made today to have him put to sleep.

Although I'm very upset at the moment, I know he is in a better place now.   <span class="pullquote">Flint was a loving and friendly dog, and I've loved him from the minute we got him as a fluffy little puppy.</span>  Rest In Peace Flint.
