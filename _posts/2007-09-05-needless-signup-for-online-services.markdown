Why must so many online services insist that you sign up in order to use them?&Acirc;&nbsp; If you are trying to use a service such as finding out train or bus times, then there is no need that I can see to request that you sign up before being shown the result of your search.&Acirc;&nbsp; I would happily sign up for a service if I was expecting some sort of email feedback; making a purchase; or making use of some other user-specific service.&Acirc;&nbsp; I have often left a site when asked to sign up before finding out the results of a search, and this has a really negative effect on my experience as a user!
