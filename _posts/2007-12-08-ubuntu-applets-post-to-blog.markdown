<p>Well, it.s 01:24 and I'm not usually up at this time.  Jo is working an inventory tonight and I don't feel like going to bed yet.  So instead, I'm playing with my Ubuntu installation on my laptop.</p><p>
I've just done an "apt-cache search applet gnome" and discovered a load of new Gnome applets.  I'm using one of them to write this post.  It's called gnome-blog and lets you specify a username and password for an existing Blog from a number of popular providers, e.g. Blogger, LiveJournal etc.</p><p>
You can also specify a URL for a your own install of Wordpress, TextPattern and many more.  Then, like me, you can post to your blog from your Gnome desktop!</p>
