I'm pleased to announce my latest offering to the interwebs.  If you've recently moved house or are otherwise in an unfamilar area, you may want to know where the nearest shops are; well <a href="http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk">http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk</a> can answer that question for you.  At the moment, just the big four supermarkets can be located, but I hope to redress that as time goes by.  I in no way endorse any store represented on the site, and provide this service "as is".  Any thoughts/suggestions are very much welcome.
