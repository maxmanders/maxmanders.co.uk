I've been somewhat remiss in updating this site in recent times.  This has largely been due to my being incredibly busy.  Since saying farewell to <a href="http://www.valleyt.co.uk">Valley Technology</a>, I've joined <a href="http://www.dietchef.co.uk">Diet Chef</a> as their web developer and general IT jack-of-all-trades.  I'm pleased to say I'm enjoying the varied work, but look forward to finding time for some more personal projects, including further developing <a href="http://www.wherearetheshops.co.uk">"Where are the shops?"</a>.

I also think, due to the ubiquity of various social networks (vis-a-vis Facebook, Twitter et al.) and the iPhone, I tend to blog less, favouring to send updates to a number of social networking sites.&nbsp; This has lead me to conclude that the present incarnation of the site isn't really working for me.&nbsp; Over the next month or so (depending on how much free time I have), I'll be reorganising things with a focus on aggregating all the snippets of 'me' that are out on the interwebs into a single stream.&nbsp; I'll still be posting longer posts and articles when I have something substantive to say, but will probably let Facebook, Twiiter, Last.FM, etc tell my story.

Hope you are all well!
