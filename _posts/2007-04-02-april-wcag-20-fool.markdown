    No, I didn't get caught by anything as far as I know.  How did the move go?

Well another April 1st has gone by and I was fooled in a pretty big way!  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200704/wcag_20_released_today/" title="WCAG2.0 Fool">Roger Johansson posted</a> that the W3 had announced WCAG2.0 was a Final Recommendation.  Of course it didn't occur to me for a moment what day it was.  And worse still - I checked the <a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="W3C">W3c</a> website - to find no news about it - even that didn't start ringing alarm bells!

Oh well - shame on me... how did you get on with April 1st!?
