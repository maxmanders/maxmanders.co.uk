The secret's out -- I'm leaving [Maglabs](http://www.maglabs.net).  The last few years
with Maglabs have been a blast, but the time's come for me take on new challenges.  I wish
my colleagues every success in the future, but I'm looking forward to the 24th of
September, when I start my new roll with [Cloudreach](http://www.cloudreach.com).  I'll be
joining the devops team, working with a wide range of platforms and languages helping our
customers take advantage of cloud technologies, particularly with services offered by
Amazon and Google.  I've even started using a MacBook, and I'm reluctant to say I'm
actually quite liking it - bet you never thought you'd hear me say that!
