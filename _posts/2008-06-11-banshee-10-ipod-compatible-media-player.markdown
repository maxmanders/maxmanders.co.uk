I've spoken before on this site about Songbird, a viable Linux alternative to iTunes.  Since my original post, I haven't really kept up with Songbird; perhaps I should have; perhaps I will.  However, in the meantime I have had Banshee 1.0 brought to my attention.

I originally used Banshee as it's UI is similar to iTunes.  I have also spoken before that although I am right at home with Ubuntu and Linux in general, I do miss a good media manager; iTunes ticks all the boxes for me and is indispensable since I use an iPod.  Banshee has pulled out the stops with the recent release of it's first major release, version 1.0

Banshee 1.0 is a massive improvement on the older version that I had initially dismissed as being too clunky; so much so that I'm going to use it instead of Rhythmbox.  Although not compatible with the most recent iPod software, it is fully compatible if you reinitialise your library and use an older version of the software on your iPod.  Since I don't really use video or images on my iPod that's fine by me.

The interface is much cleaner and it is clear that a lot of time has been spent polishing it.  Last.FM is built in, as is a 'favourites' and 'recently added' play list.  These last features were missing from Rhythmbox and I really liked them in iTunes.  In addition, there is an "Unheard" playlist - now I can make a point of listening to the tracks that I forgot I even had!

In summary - a big thumbs up from me to the Banshee development team.  Banshee 1.0 is a more mature and usable piece of software that it's predecessor and I look forward to seeing it develop further.  Having said that, I will take another look at Songbird...
