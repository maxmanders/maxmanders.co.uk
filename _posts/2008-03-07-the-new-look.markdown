I decided some time ago that I wasn't happy with the way this site looked.&nbsp; Unfortunately I haven't had much time to do anything about it.&nbsp; I've finally got around to making some changes, the most important of which you may notice is the minimalist design.&nbsp; I don't know if I plan to change this any time in the future, but for now it will do.

I've also tried to pull in some data from other services I use (perhaps not as frequently as I would like) such as Twitter, Facebook and Flickr.&nbsp; To that end, my recent Twitter tweets are now displayed, together with my Facebook status.&nbsp; I've also pulled in some random images from my public Flickr collection.
