Having upgraded my Hardy distribution to Intrepd, I can say that I'm impressed.&nbsp; The changes to the desktop, although subtle, are very much welcome.&nbsp; I haven't had any teething troubles with any of my hardware; the only 'glitch' I've noticed involves the title bars of open applications, it goes transparent now and then - but I'm sure I can put up with it until it gets fixed.&nbsp; Good work Ubuntu!
