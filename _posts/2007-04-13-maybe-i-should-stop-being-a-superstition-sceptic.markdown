Well it's <strong>Friday 13th</strong> April today - and I've never been one for superstition - but...

I started feeling ill earlier this week and this morning it peaked.  I phoned in sick to work.  Partly because I'm not up to going around in circles with XSLT and XSL-FO trying to make an XML document pretty whilst coughing my lungs up and having my head filled with illness induced concrete; partly because I didn't want to inflict this horrible cold on my colleagues.  It was a shame because I had a meeting scheduled today that I wanted to attend - never mind.

As if that weren't enough I eventually dragged myself out of bed to do some cleaning as my parents and sister are coming down tomorrow.  Started in the kitchen, moved onto the living room and thought I'd put a load of washing on. BIG MISTAKE.  It would appear there is a loose fitting in the plumbing under the sink.  I can't use the washing machine or sink unless I want a small lake in the middle of the kitchen floor.  Have to wait until Monday for a plumber to come around and sort it.

Things to do this weekend:- buy new underwear and clothes or go to a laundrette; become skilled at washing dishes in a basin without putting water over the edge, thus flooding kitchen.  Oh the joys!
