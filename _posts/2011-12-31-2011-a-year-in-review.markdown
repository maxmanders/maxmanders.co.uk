  2011 has truly been a fantastic year!

2011 has truly been a fantastic year!

Without a doubt, the highlight of my year has to be <a title="Our Wedding" href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/2011/06/26/our-wedding/">marrying</a> my darling wife <a href="http://twitter.com/mrsjmanders">Jo</a>. &nbsp;It was a <a title="Our Wedding" href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/2011/06/26/our-wedding/">perfect, wonderful day</a>, and we all enjoyed a brilliant reception in the evening. &nbsp;That was followed by an <a title="Parisian Honeymoon" href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/2011/07/11/parisian-honeymoon/">amazing honeymoon</a> in the gorgeous French capital of Paris; and after 27 years, my first trip abroad!<!--more--> &nbsp;Jo and I also managed to squeeze in a second holiday, or honeymoon-part-deux to Nice in October, which was as equally amazing as Paris -- we'll definitely be back!

We also both managed to stop smoking, which is a fantastic achievement for us both! &nbsp;I originally stopped at the start of the year, but fell off the wagon when we went to Paris. &nbsp;Still we've both stopped <em>now</em>&nbsp;and that's what's important. &nbsp;I've also spent the majority of the year cycling to work, and managed to lose a bit of weight in the process -- long may that trend continue!

I also had an excellent year professionally! &nbsp;I made it to the <a title="The Highland Fling 2011 &ndash; Web Standard In Scotland" href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/2011/07/13/the-highland-fling-2011-web-standard-in-scotland/">Highland Fling</a> <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/">conference</a> in my home town of Edinburgh. &nbsp;A brilliantly well organised and run conference with a great line up of speakers. &nbsp;It made me realise that although I'm not a particularly skilled designer, I haven't been paying enough attention to front-end tools and techniques; something I hope to remedy in the year ahead. &nbsp;I also took on a new role with <a href="http://www.maglabs.net">Maglabs</a> as a Business Analyst; I'll be spending more time gathering requirements and designing software than coding. &nbsp;This may give me more head space to work on some personal projects and contribute more to this blog!

I managed to release something on Github! &nbsp;<a href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/msie2vbox">MSIE2VBOX</a> (catchy!) is a little script to automate installation of VMs from Microsoft for testing Internet Explorer on VirtualBox. &nbsp;It's a little buggy, but I'm trying to keep up!
<h3>... 2012</h3>
Who knows what 2012 has in store?! Having had a taste for travelling abroad, I think Jo and I would both like to get away for a holiday again. &nbsp;There's a good chance I'll be travelling more, albeit with work and within the UK, as I continue &nbsp;to analyse and design brilliant software for brilliant clients. &nbsp;Sadly that means a few nights away from my lovely wife but I'm sure we'll cope! &nbsp;I'd also like to spend more time working on a few personal coding projects, as well as doing more technical writing on this blog. &nbsp;I've also been to far too few local meetups in Edinburgh so I'd like to make an appearance at <a href="http://www.edlug.org.uk/">EdLUG</a>, <a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">TechMeetup</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/EdiPUG/">EdiPUG</a> more this coming year.

I've been playing more trombone this year, and it's something I want to make more of a habit; I might try and find a band or orchestra to join. &nbsp;I also want to read more and take more photos. &nbsp;I might try the whole photo365 thingumy and take a reasonable photo every day in 2012!

Wishing everyone happiness and prosperity for the year ahead!
