excerpt: |-
  Our cat Ziggy likes to play with things, very random things (that's her below; she's a little larger now).  For example, if we've had a bag of crisps, we'll tie the bag into a knot and throw it on the floor for her to play with.   We try and pick her "toys" up after her, but a few get through the net as she runs around with them in her mouth no doubt building a secret stash of them in a corner somewhere.  Guess what - today I found that secret stash.

  I've spent some of this afternoon tinkering with my site layout and style, and became aware of a larger than normal concentration of these crisp packet knots in the office/guest bedroom.

I've spent some of this afternoon tinkering with my site layout and style, and became aware of a larger than normal concentration of these crisp packet knots in the office/guest bedroom.<!--more-->  I don't remember her bringing anything in while I've been at the computer, so thought I'd investigate.  I pulled the bed-side cabinet out of the way, and pulled the bed out from the wall and bingo! I'd found it!
Here is a photo of what I found under the bed.  It would seem she doesn't just like crisp packets, but anything small, manageable and carryable.

The contents of this stash are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>43 crisp packet knots</li>
	<li>2 lighters</li>
	<li>1 box of matches</li>
	<li>1 miscellaneous plastic item (not a clue what it is or where it came from)</li>
	<li>7 miscellaneous sweet wrappers</li>
	<li>1 Hershey's Kisses box</li>
	<li>1 small, slightly chewed catnip mouse</li>
	<li>3 pens, including a CD labeling pen which I presumed had been binned</li>
	<li>a small roll of tape</li>
	<li>a tube of lypsyl</li>
</ul>
I should add I am not addicted to crisps, nor is Jo - this stash of goodies has been accumulating for goodness knows how long!
