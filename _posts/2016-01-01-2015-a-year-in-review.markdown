With 2015 behind me, and 2016 ahead, it's that time of the year where I reflect
on the past year.  This is really a retrospective, and in the same way that my
team conducts *agile* retrospectives as part of our workflow, I thought I'd
approach the past year in that stop/start/continue fashion.

Though to begin with, there are a few things that don't really fit into the
different retrospective buckets.  Firstly, although it was a difficult decision
to make, I'm glad to have moved on from Cloudreach to FanDuel.  I'm working with
technology I know and love every day, and also continually learning new things.
I'm less stressed with less responsibility weighing down on my shoulders.  I'm
happy. 

Jo and I spend our fourth wedding anniversary having an impromptu road-trip of the
Scottish borders in our new car.  Great fun, and couldn't go back to not having the
flexibility having a car affords us.

We also spent Jo's birthday in Paris in November.  The last night of our holiday is one
which I won't forget for a long time, the night that Paris fell victim to terrorism:
shootings; bombings; awful senseless violence and tragedy.  *Je suis Paris*.

## Stop
* Stop saying *yes*.  In the past, I've been encouraged to be more positive and
open-minded by saying *yes* more.  While this sounds fine in principal, I tend
to go out of my way more than I probably should any way, and this results in
less time for myself, and more worry and stress about deadlines and issues that
I've brought upon myself.  Were I to have said no, nobody would have thought
any less of me, the thing that I was asked to do would still have been done,
and I wouldn't have invested any time or emotion in whatever thing that may
have been.  That sounds like a much better position to be in, in terms of being
happier and having more time to do the things I want to do.
* Stop giving myself a hard time about trying to quit smoking.  When I do finally quit,
that'll be great.  For whatever time I do manage to abstain, that'll be great too.  If
I stumble a little along the way, I'll deal with it, accept that shit happens, and try
again.
* Stop eating crap: I've put on a lot of weight this year, and 2016 needs to see that
weight lost.

## Start
* Start saying *no*.  A corollary to the point above, stopping saying *yes*
necessarily means saying *no* more.  That's not something I'm particularly good at, or
comfortable doing, but something I definitely must start to do.
* Start dieting: I desperately need to lose some of the weight I've put on this year, and
that means more exercise and a calorie controlled diet.  I'll be properly tracking what I
eat with My Fitness Pal, and trying to walk a lot more.
* Start playing trombone again.  I'm hoping that saying no more, and spending less time
on my laptop outside of work, will mean I can spend more time enjoying playing trombone.
* Start writing more.  Every year I resolve to write more posts on this site, and 
hopefully this year, that's a goal I can achieve!

## Continue
* Continue doing my best to stop smoking.  My goal is to stop smoking cigarettes: be that
completely, or *vaping* an electronic cigarette.
* Continue my annual birthday tradition of getting a new tattoo.  Last January
I had a New Zealand fern added to my inner-left forearm, reflecting my Kiwi
heritage.  I've designed a simple trombone and bass clef motif that I'll add to
my tattoo collection for my birthday this year.
* Continue being a technical reviewer.  I've reviewed two more books this year for Packt
Publishing, providing my feedback on the content in general, and its technical accuracy.
I'm keep to help with anything related to DevOps, Puppet, Chef or Ruby!
* Continue travelling when I can. I've been lucky enough to do quite a bit of travelling
this year: two visits to Amsterdam (one with Cloudreach and one with FanDuel for
Velocity Conference); a week in Paris for Jo's birthday; a trip to New York with work.
I'm hoping to have another opportunity to get back to New York, hopefully with Jo this
time.
* Continue attending tech conferences.  Going to tech conferences is a great
opportunity to travel; meet and talk with new, like-minded individuals; listen to great
talks by my peers, respected voices in the wider community.  I've always had a problem
with social anxiety, particularly in large groups of people I don't know.  I often find it
easier to hurray back to the quiet safety of my hotel room.  But I want to keep trying
to get better, and conferences are a great way to work on that.
* Continue reading more.  I finally finished Peter F. Hamilton's "The Void" trilogy on 
Audible audio book this year; I finished all but the most recent of Richard L. Sanders'
"Phoenix" series; and I made a start on a second read of William Gibson's "Neuromancer".
Once I've finished "Neuromancer" I'll crack on with "The Phoenix Reckoning Part I".
After that, who knows, but I want to keep up the habit of reading as much as I can.
