  content: I wasn't aware there was DRM on Bioshock.  I was going to wait a few months until some of the nastier bugs in the PC version have been ironed out - but now I'm going to have to consider whether I love my principles or Bioshock-goodness more...

I've finally given in to the SecuROM DRM that ships with the PC version of Bioshock.&Acirc;&nbsp; After reading so many good things about the game, and an equal number of bad things about the DRM I had planned to boycott 2K games and resist purchasing Bioshock.

Unfortunately, I downloaded the demo version last week (complete with rookit style SecuROM) - and I have to say I was very impressed!&Acirc;&nbsp; I decided to part with &Acirc;&pound;30.00 of hard earned cash and buy the game.&Acirc;&nbsp; Things aren't as bad as they were; you can now install Bioshock up to 5 times on 5 different machines so this should give me plenty of wiggle room.&Acirc;&nbsp; It's just a shame that DRM has become so restrictive that attempts to prevent copyright infringement result in the customer being punished.
