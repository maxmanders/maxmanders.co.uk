  I'm sure I'm trailing behind here, but I've just been introduced to the wonderful worlds of <a target="_blank" title="Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a title="Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.
  
  Twitter was originally developed to allow people to have real time instant messaging using their mobile telephones, but has since been extended to offer the same functionality through a web browser.

I'm sure I'm trailing behind here, but I've just been introduced to the wonderful worlds of <a target="_blank" title="Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> and <a title="Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.

Twitter was originally developed to allow people to have real time instant messaging using their mobile telephones, but has since been extended to offer the same functionality through a web browser.<!--more--> ?  You can type in little messages on your account to indicate your status, or what you are doing.?  You can invite people to use Twitter and associate them with your profile, which allows you to share your status and other brief messages with them.?  Since this was built for mobile users, and because it isn't intended to be a full blown messenger, there is a character limit.?  But hey - it's a great idea.

I've also started using Facebook.?  Originally developed to allow university students to network with each other, Facebook allows you to invite friends to network with you.?  You can specify your relationship to your friend and other bits of information.?  There is a great feature called a wall.?  You and your friends can write on each others Wall, leaving messages for each other.?  You can use Facebook to remind you of people's birthdays; add photos; send messages; and much more - have a look - it's pretty cool!
