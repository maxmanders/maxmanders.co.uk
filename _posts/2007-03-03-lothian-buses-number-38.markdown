Aaargh.  That's all I can say about the number 38 service of Lothian Buses.  Possibly <em>the</em> most inconsistent bus of all those that travel the roads of this planet (not that I ever use hyperbole - or litotes for that matter).  Granted, it is one of the few buses that serve both the Western General Hospital and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary at each terminus respectively.  However, if the bus requires extra time at either end to transfer the ill and infirm then please Lothian Buses, I implore you, lay on extra buses - double-deckers even (never a seat on this perpetually late bus), or alter the timetable accordingly.  The bus was half-an-hour overdue in which time I watched three 33s, two 25s, four 3s (two of which arrived at the same time) pass me - none of which were of any use.  Fate it would seem is not without a sense of irony; this "bus o' doom" also serves the new flat I'm moving to at the end of the month.  Thankfully there are a number of more reliable buses there!  Here endeth the rant.
