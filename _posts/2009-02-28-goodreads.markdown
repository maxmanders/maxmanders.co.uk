I've just come across <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">goodreads</a> - another social-networking site, with a difference.&nbsp; The site lets you add books&nbsp; you've read with arbitrary tags, giving reviews, ratings etc.&nbsp; The site also offers a REST API that returns XML based on request URIs using OAuth for authentication where required.&nbsp; I'm going to add some books to it and have a play with the API.
