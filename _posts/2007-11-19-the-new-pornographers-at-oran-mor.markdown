As part of <img src="/media/npticket.gif" title="New Pornographers Ticket" alt="New Pornographers Ticket" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" />my birthday present to my Jo, I took her to see <a href="http://www.thenewpornographers.com/" title="The New Pornographers website">The New Pornographers</a> at <a href="http://www.oran-mor.co.uk/" title="Oran Mor, Glasgow">Oran Mor</a> in Glasgow on Sunday night.&Acirc;&nbsp; I saw Neko Case there last year on Jo's birthday and it is a fantastic venue.&Acirc;&nbsp; It's not too large and the sounds is brilliant.

This was my first time seeing The New Pornographers live and I certainly wasn't disappointed.&Acirc;&nbsp; Jo saw them a few years ago, but unfortunately Neko didn't join the band on either occasion.&Acirc;&nbsp; This meant they didn't perform "Fail Safe", one of my favourite tracks from the new <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Challengers-New-Pornographers/dp/B000S9KSC8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1195504846&amp;sr=8-1" title="Challenger at Amazon.co.uk">Challengers</a> album (as Neko and Kathryn perform wonderful harmonies on this track).&Acirc;&nbsp; Nonetheless I enjoyed the concert very much!

There was a good mix of the old and new, although no sneak previews of upcoming material.&Acirc;&nbsp; They performed a number of tracks from their latest album, as well as a great selection from previous albums: "Sing Me Spanish Techno"; "Bleeding Hearts Show" and "The Laws Have Changed" to name but a few.&Acirc;&nbsp; And just when we thought it was over, they came back on stage to do a good few songs for the encore.&Acirc;&nbsp; All in all, a brilliant concert even if Neko didn't make an appearance!
