Coming up in April is the inaugural <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007" title="The Highland Fling">Highland Fling conference</a>.  A meet up of web developers and designers aimed at getting the Scottish interweb community involved with some of the big names in web development.  There are a number of speakers including <a href="http://adactio.com" title="Adactio">Jeremy Keith</a>.  The day after the conference, Friday 06 April is <a href="http://refreshedinburgh.org/" title="Refresh Edinburgh">Refresh Edinburgh</a>.  A more informal gathering where developers can discuss the state of the web with like-minded people.  I will be there, and I hope as many other developers in Scotland as possible, who like me don't often have a chance to meet and greet at conference-type-events, will be there too.  See you there!
