have another <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=463770" title="Competition Rules">competition</a> on the go.  The winner gets a copy of the new book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Beautiful-Web-Design/dp/0975841963/ref=pd_ka_1/026-9838655-5211652?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173992708&amp;sr=8-1" title="Principles of Beautiful Web Design">"Principles of Beautiful Web Design"</a>.  The competition involves using CSS to style some simple markup that serves as an <a href="http://www.pmob.co.uk/sitepoint-comp/sitepoint-principles.htm" title="Sitepoint Competition markup">advert for the book</a>.  Unfortunately the markup hooks available for use with CSS are somewhat lean.  I've given it a <a href="http://maxmanders.co.uk/sitepoint" title="My attempt at the Sitepoint Competition">shot</a>, as have <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=463769" title="Other Entries">others</a>.  Why don't you have a go -  you have until the 6th of April to enter as many entries as you like.  Happy coding!
