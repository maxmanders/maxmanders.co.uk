I've just read <a href="http://www.colly.com/comments/the-killers/" title="Colly's rant-post about the Killers">Colly's rant-post</a> about the Killers, and have to say I agree with him entirely.?  I enjoyed Hot Fuss with some similar reservations about the first few tracks.?  After reading this rant I had another listen of Sam's Town - great album.?  Give The Killers a chance.
