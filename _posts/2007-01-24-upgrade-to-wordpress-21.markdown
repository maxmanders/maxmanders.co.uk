I've just upgraded to Wordpress 2.1 and I have to say the process couldn't have gone more smoothly.?  I backed up my entire database using phpMyAdmin; took a copy of my wordpress directory structure; uploaded the new files; copied wp-confog.php, .htaccess, wp-content back; ran the upgrade script and that was all there was to it.?  I was expecting some troubles but there were none to speak of!?  Well done Wordpress.
