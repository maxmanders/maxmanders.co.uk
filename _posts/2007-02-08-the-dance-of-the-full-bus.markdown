title: The Dance of the Full Bus
comments: []

excerpt: I wonder if this is an event that happens everywhere or if it is peculiar to the passengers of Edinburgh's bus service?  I have noticed that the dance frequently occurs on a packed bus.  When the bus stops and people get off,  you will see all the people sharing a seat get up and peek, meerkat-like, for a newly vacated seat.  These passengers then perform an ornate must-get-that-seat-first maneuver, quick-stepping down the gangway to the shiny empty seat.

I can only assume these people have an inherent dislike, or mistrust of their fellow passenger.  I personally don't make a habit of joining in the dance unless I happen to be sitting next to someone who has a mysterious bad odor or such.  Perhaps my reluctance to dance with the other passengers and instead remain seated next to a perfect stranger is odd?  Perhaps I am being paranoid? I shall continue to enjoy this spectacle in the early morning journey to work nonetheless!
